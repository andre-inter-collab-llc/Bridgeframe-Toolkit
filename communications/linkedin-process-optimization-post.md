**Why Your Best Epidemiologist Shouldn't Be Managing Your Project**

I've watched this pattern play out dozens of times in public health:

A brilliant scientist—the person who *actually understands* the data, the methods, the clinical nuances—gets handed project management duties. Meanwhile, a capable project manager is expected to navigate scientific decisions that took the SME years to master.

The result? Everyone loses.

🔬 **The scientist** spends 20 hours/week scheduling meetings, chasing deliverables, and updating Gantt charts—work that doesn't require their expertise.

📋 **The project manager** struggles to make technical decisions, constantly asking "but what does that *mean*?" while the team grows frustrated.

📉 **The program** misses deadlines because nobody is doing their actual job well.

This is what I call **role confusion**—and it's one of the most expensive inefficiencies in public health organizations.

**The fix isn't complicated, but it requires discipline:**

| Role | Focus |
|------|-------|
| **Project Manager** | *How* and *when*—timelines, logistics, stakeholder coordination |
| **Subject Matter Expert** | *What* and *why*—technical direction, methodology, quality |
| **Leader** | *Where*—vision, strategy, resource allocation |

These roles can overlap in small teams. But they should *never* be confused.

In one cancer surveillance project I document in **Bridgeframe**, restructuring these roles led to:
- 60% increase in the epidemiologist's scientific output
- 40% improvement in sprint velocity
- Staff satisfaction scores jumping from 2.8 to 4.2

The lesson? **Stop paying expert rates for administrative work.** Let your scientists do science. Let your coordinators coordinate.

Process optimization isn't just about automation and workflows—it's about putting the right people in the right roles.

More on this in Chapter 12 of the Bridgeframe Toolkit, where I explore how psychological safety, role clarity, and disciplined project management come together to maximize public health impact.

## Alternative Hook Options

**Option B (Automation angle):**
"A beautiful dashboard that handles 100 records is worth less than an ugly script that processes 10,000."

**Option C (Taxpayer accountability angle):**
"Could you explain to a taxpayer why this process exists and how it improves public health? If not, eliminate it."

**Option D (Psychology angle):**
"Process optimization fails when we forget that processes are run by people. Start with meaning, safety, and autonomy—then automate."
