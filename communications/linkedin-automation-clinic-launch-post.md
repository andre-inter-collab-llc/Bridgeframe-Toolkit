title: "LinkedIn Post: Public Health Automation Clinic Launch"

## Post Draft

**Public health professionals: stop wasting your expertise on tasks a script could do in seconds.**

Throughout my career, I have heard the same story from epidemiologists, registrars, and analysts:

"I spend an entire day renaming files."
"I manually copy data between three spreadsheets every quarter."

These are not analytical problems. They are mechanical tasks that consume thousands of hours across the workforce, hours better spent on surveillance, outreach, and analysis.

The gap is not technology. It is **translation**: knowing a solution exists, and having someone turn your problem into code.

**Today I am launching the Public Health Automation Clinic.**

A free service through Intersect Collaborations:

1. Describe a repetitive task via a short intake form
2. I develop a solution using R, Python, and free open source tools (Posit ecosystem: RStudio, Quarto, Shiny)
3. The solution is anonymized and published publicly so anyone can benefit

No contracts. No invoices. Every solution runs on your computer, no cloud AI subscriptions required.

**What qualifies?** Anything repetitive and definable:
- Data extraction, cleaning, transformation, or validation
- Recurring analyses or surveillance reports
- Report generation (epidemiological or project management)
- File renaming, conversion, or organization
- Business process automation (e.g., project reports from GanttProject)
- Any "I do this exact same thing every week/month/quarter" task

The intake form is **anonymous**. Solutions are always anonymized and generalized before publishing.

If you are comfortable, **comment on this post with a challenge you face.** Many of you are fighting the same battles in different offices. Visibility is the first step to solving them at scale. Already have a solution? Share it in the comments too.

## Post Notes

- **Character count**: ~2,800 (within LinkedIn's 3,000-character limit for posts)
- **Image suggestion**: Use the Mermaid workflow diagram from the chapter (fig-automation-clinic-flow) or create a simple branded graphic with the text "Public Health Automation Clinic | Free Service | Submit Your Problem"
- **Timing**: Post Tuesday or Wednesday morning (highest LinkedIn engagement for professional content)
- **Follow-up**: After initial submissions come in, post a follow-up showing an anonymized example of a problem solved
- **Engagement strategy**: Monitor comments for problems shared publicly; these indicate high-demand topics to prioritize. Respond to each comment acknowledging the problem and noting it has been captured.

## Responses to Comments

### Reshare: "What a great effort from André"

Thank you for the kind words and for sharing this with your network. The more visibility these kinds of problems get, the closer we get to solving them at scale. If you or anyone in your network has a repetitive task eating into their analytical time, the intake form is always open.

### Repost: Edwin (former manager, no notes)

Thank you for sharing this, Edwin. It means a lot coming from you. You were the one who first pushed me to think about automation in my epidemiology work years ago when you were my manager. A lot of what drives this initiative traces back to that mindset you helped instill: if you are doing the same thing twice, find a way to make the computer do it. I appreciate the support.

### Repost #2 (no notes)

Really appreciate you helping spread the word. The goal is to reach the people who need this most but might not know a solution exists. Thank you.

### Comment: MPH curricula and automation training gaps

This is an excellent point and one I think about often. I agree; most MPH programs treat scripting as an epidemiology tool (clean data, run models, generate output) rather than as a general-purpose problem-solving skill. The result is a workforce that can run a logistic regression in R but still manually renames 200 files by hand.

What is unfortunate is that R and Python are incredibly powerful programming languages capable of far more than data cleaning and statistical analysis. They should be taught as general-purpose tools for any repetitive task, not just epidemiological pipelines.

Business process automation, desktop automation, and workflow design are core competencies in IT business analysis but almost entirely absent from public health training. That is exactly the gap Bridgeframe tries to address: translating tools and thinking between these two worlds.

I would love to see schools of public health incorporate even a single module on "automating the work around the work," not just the analytical pipeline. If you have connections in that space, I am always happy to collaborate on curriculum ideas.

### Comment: Handling updates and evolving needs for anonymized solutions

Great question, and an honest limitation worth acknowledging.

The free clinic is a hobby project I work on between paid engagements. I have benefitted tremendously from open source tools and communities throughout my career, and this is my way of giving back. Solutions are designed to be modular and well-documented so that someone with basic R or Python familiarity can adapt them to changing requirements. The goal is a tool you own and understand, not a black box.

That said, for ongoing updates, evolving workflows, or more complex needs, the realistic path is a paid consulting engagement through Intersect Collaborations. What I am hoping is that some of those clients would agree to make the generalizable portions of the work publicly available so that others can benefit too.

For anyone considering a submission, I recommend reading the full initiative description, which sets expectations clearly: https://andre-inter-collab-llc.github.io/Bridgeframe-Toolkit/chapters/13-automation-intake.html#the-initiative

The long-term vision is a growing library of public health automation patterns, built through both the free submissions and (with client agreement) the paid work, that reduces the barrier for everyone. While this is currently a one-person effort, I am planning to make the solution library available as a public GitHub repository where others can contribute their own solutions and improvements too.

For those looking to get started with automation, I also offer a training course, "Automating Public Health Analytics with R, Quarto, and Windows Tools." It covers the background, skills, and tools needed to automate basic tasks and get the most out of what the clinic provides. It is not a requirement for submitting or using the clinic, but it can help you hit the ground running with the solutions.
