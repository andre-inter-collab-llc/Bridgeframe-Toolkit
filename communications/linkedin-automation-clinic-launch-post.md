## Post Draft

**Public health professionals: stop wasting your expertise on tasks a script could do in seconds.**

Throughout my career, I have heard the same story from epidemiologists, registrars, and program analysts:

"I spend an entire day renaming files."
"I manually copy data between three spreadsheets every quarter."

These are not complex analytical problems. They are repetitive, mechanical tasks that quietly consume thousands of hours across the public health workforce, hours that should be spent on surveillance, outreach, and analysis.

The solutions often already exist. A 20-line Python script. A free tool you have never heard of. An R function that does in two seconds what takes you two hours.

The gap is not technology. It is **translation**: knowing that the solution exists, and having someone turn your problem into code.

**Today I am launching the Public Health Automation Clinic.**

It is a free service through Intersect Collaborations. Here is how it works:

1. You describe a repetitive, tedious task via a short intake form
2. I develop a solution using R, Python, and free open source tools (especially the Posit ecosystem: RStudio, Quarto, Shiny)
3. The solution is anonymized, generalized, and published publicly so anyone facing a similar problem can benefit

No contracts. No invoices. Submissions are handled as time allows. All solutions are made publicly available as generic resources.

**Every solution runs on your computer.** No cloud AI subscriptions required. A deterministic script you can run locally is more reliable, efficient, and sustainable than sending your data to a remote API.

**What qualifies?**

Anything repetitive and definable, especially data management and analysis:
- Data extraction from PDFs, spreadsheets, or legacy exports
- Data cleaning, transformation, and validation
- Recurring statistical analyses or surveillance reports
- Report generation (epidemiological or project management)
- File renaming, conversion, or organization
- Geocoding addresses without expensive software
- Business process automation (e.g., project status reports from GanttProject or similar tools)
- Any "I do this exact same thing every week/month/quarter" problem

**What does NOT qualify:**
- Building full applications or databases
- Tasks requiring access to proprietary systems
- Clinical judgment calls

**"But I do not want to share my problem publicly."**

Understood. That is exactly why the intake form is anonymous. You do not need to identify yourself or your organization. Solutions are always anonymized and generalized before publishing.

That said, if you are comfortable, I encourage you to **comment on this post with a challenge you face** and give it a like. That helps me (and everyone else) see just how widespread these problems are. Many of you are fighting the same battles in different offices. Visibility is the first step to solving them at scale.

Already have a solution that works? **Share it in the comments too.** This is a community effort.

**Why am I doing this?**

Because I have sat in both chairs: the data scientist who builds the tools, and the epidemiologist who needs them. Too many public health professionals are stuck doing manual work not because better options do not exist, but because nobody with the right skills has looked at their specific problem.

Every solution built through the clinic is a small investment that compounds: one script can save dozens of hours per year, across multiple people, for years.

This is part of the Bridgeframe Toolkit, my open resource bridging business analysis and public health practice.

**Submit your problem here:** [INTAKE FORM LINK]

Anonymous submissions welcome. All solutions are published as free, generic resources.

If you need urgent, private, or organization-specific help, Intersect Collaborations offers paid consulting.

Know someone drowning in manual data work? Tag them. Have a challenge? Drop it in the comments. Already solved one? Share it.

## Post Notes

- **Character count**: ~2,800 (within LinkedIn's 3,000-character limit for posts)
- **Replace** `[INTAKE FORM LINK]` with the actual Google Forms URL after creation
- **Image suggestion**: Use the Mermaid workflow diagram from the chapter (fig-automation-clinic-flow) or create a simple branded graphic with the text "Public Health Automation Clinic | Free Service | Submit Your Problem"
- **Timing**: Post Tuesday or Wednesday morning (highest LinkedIn engagement for professional content)
- **Follow-up**: After initial submissions come in, post a follow-up showing an anonymized example of a problem solved
- **Engagement strategy**: Monitor comments for problems shared publicly; these indicate high-demand topics to prioritize. Respond to each comment acknowledging the problem and noting it has been captured.
