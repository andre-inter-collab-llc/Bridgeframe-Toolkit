title: "LinkedIn Post: Public Health Automation Clinic Launch"

## Post Draft

**Public health professionals: stop wasting your expertise on tasks a script could do in seconds.**

Throughout my career, I have heard the same story from epidemiologists, registrars, and analysts:

"I spend an entire day renaming files."
"I manually copy data between three spreadsheets every quarter."

These are not analytical problems. They are mechanical tasks that consume thousands of hours across the workforce, hours better spent on surveillance, outreach, and analysis.

The gap is not technology. It is **translation**: knowing a solution exists, and having someone turn your problem into code.

**Today I am launching the Public Health Automation Clinic.**

A free service through Intersect Collaborations:

1. Describe a repetitive task via a short intake form
2. I develop a solution using R, Python, and free open source tools (Posit ecosystem: RStudio, Quarto, Shiny)
3. The solution is anonymized and published publicly so anyone can benefit

No contracts. No invoices. Every solution runs on your computer, no cloud AI subscriptions required.

**What qualifies?** Anything repetitive and definable:
- Data extraction, cleaning, transformation, or validation
- Recurring analyses or surveillance reports
- Report generation (epidemiological or project management)
- File renaming, conversion, or organization
- Business process automation (e.g., project reports from GanttProject)
- Any "I do this exact same thing every week/month/quarter" task

The intake form is **anonymous**. Solutions are always anonymized and generalized before publishing.

If you are comfortable, **comment on this post with a challenge you face.** Many of you are fighting the same battles in different offices. Visibility is the first step to solving them at scale. Already have a solution? Share it in the comments too.

## Post Notes

- **Character count**: ~2,800 (within LinkedIn's 3,000-character limit for posts)
- **Image suggestion**: Use the Mermaid workflow diagram from the chapter (fig-automation-clinic-flow) or create a simple branded graphic with the text "Public Health Automation Clinic | Free Service | Submit Your Problem"
- **Timing**: Post Tuesday or Wednesday morning (highest LinkedIn engagement for professional content)
- **Follow-up**: After initial submissions come in, post a follow-up showing an anonymized example of a problem solved
- **Engagement strategy**: Monitor comments for problems shared publicly; these indicate high-demand topics to prioritize. Respond to each comment acknowledging the problem and noting it has been captured.
