# LinkedIn Post: Medallion Architecture Translation

## Post Content

**Why Your "Bronze, Silver, Gold" Data Talk Is Losing Your Public Health Clients**

Last week, I watched a data engineer enthusiastically explain their "medallion architecture" to a room of epidemiologists.

The blank stares said it all.

"We'll land the lab feeds in Bronze, transform them in Silver, and expose the line lists from Gold."

The epi team heard: "We'll do... something... with your data... somehow."

**Here's the thing:** The medallion architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) is a powerful framework for organizing data pipelines. It's become standard vocabulary in IT and data engineering circles since Databricks popularized it around 2020.

But most public health professionals have never heard these terms.

And why would they? They've been doing the *same work* for decades using different language:

📥 **Bronze** = Raw data, source files, incoming data
🔄 **Silver** = Cleaned data, standardized data, processed data  
📊 **Gold** = Final reports, line lists, dashboards

The concepts are identical. Only the jargon differs.

**If you're a BA or data professional working in public health, here's my recommendation:**

✅ Reserve "medallion" terminology for conversations with IT architects and data engineers

✅ Use familiar terms with epidemiologists and program staff: "raw data," "cleaned data," "final reports"

✅ When documenting systems, include BOTH vocabularies so everyone can understand

✅ Remember: A line list for contact tracing is a Gold-layer artifact, even if the epi who creates it has never heard that term

The goal isn't to teach public health professionals IT jargon. It's to build systems that serve their mission.

Translation is the bridge professional's superpower. Use it.

## Posting Notes

- **Target audience:** BAs, data engineers, health informaticists working in public health
- **Link:** https://[your-github-pages-url]/chapters/03-terminology.html#data-architecture-medallion-architecture-for-public-health
- **Best posting times:** Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM or 12-1 PM
- **Engagement strategy:** Ask a question at the end to encourage comments
- **Image suggestion:** A simple diagram showing Bronze/Silver/Gold with PH equivalent terms, or a "translation card" graphic

## Alternate Shorter Version (if needed)

"We'll land it in Bronze and promote to Gold."

Translation for public health colleagues: "We'll save the raw file and move it to the final reports folder."

Same concept. Different vocabulary.

If you're a BA working in public health, speak their language. "Medallion architecture" means nothing to most epidemiologists—but "raw data → cleaned data → line lists" makes perfect sense.

The concepts aren't new. Data managers have organized files this way for decades. Only the jargon is new.

Your job isn't to teach IT vocabulary. It's to build systems that serve public health.
