## Post Content

**Stop competing with 1,000 applicants for the same job.**

When an influencer posts a list of "10 Public Health Jobs Hiring Now," that list loses its value within hours. Candidates end up competing not just with qualified professionals, but with everyone who saw that post.

At Intersect Collaborations, we've spent the past 7 months developing a different approach as part of our mission to support the public health informatics workforce.

Instead of *reacting* to job postings, what if you could *anticipate* where opportunities will emerge before they're advertised?

In public health and government IT, the paper trail is public:

📄 **RFPs reveal demand** — A "Surveillance System Modernization" contract signals that cloud, SQL, and training skills are about to be in high demand in that region.

📄 **Contract awards reveal employers** — The vendor who just won a multi-million dollar CDC contract needs to staff up immediately.

We've compiled these strategies into a free chapter of the Bridgeframe Toolkit, a resource we're building to bridge business analysis and public health practice:

✅ Google Boolean search strings to find RFPs, contract awards, and unadvertised opportunities  
✅ How to set up Google Alerts for passive monitoring  
✅ A directory of specialized platforms (USAJobs, ORISE, AMIA, and more)  
✅ The "proactive application" approach that bypasses the resume pile  
✅ Volunteer platforms for building real experience  
✅ Resume translation strategies for hybrid professionals

**This is meant to be a collaborative resource.**

Our goal is to develop something genuinely useful for the broader public health community, and that works best with input from people navigating this space every day.

💬 If you've developed Google search strings that work well for finding relevant opportunities, we'd welcome you to share them in the comments.

💬 If you know of a company, health department, or organization doing meaningful work at the intersection of technology and public health, please tag them or mention them below.

💬 If you're working on a project that could benefit from a hybrid perspective, or if you're interested in collaborating, we'd love to hear from you. Reach out through our website or send us a message.

Public health doesn't just need technical skills. It needs people who understand the context. It needs translators.

Hey everyone 👋

I've been working on something that might be useful for those of us still job hunting.

You know how every time someone posts a "jobs list" online, it's basically useless because 500 other people saw it too? I put together a guide on a different approach — finding opportunities *before* they're posted.

The basic idea: in government/public health, RFPs and contract awards are public. If you find an RFP for "surveillance system modernization," you know exactly what skills are about to be in demand. Find the contract award, and you know which company just got funded and needs to hire immediately.

I wrote up the whole strategy with:
• Google search strings you can copy/paste
• How to set up alerts so opportunities come to you
• List of job boards specific to our field
• Tips on the "blind application" (reaching out before jobs are posted)
• Volunteer sites to build experience while searching

Here's the link: [LINK]

Happy to share any of the search strings directly if that's easier. And if you find companies or opportunities worth knowing about, send them my way. I'm trying to keep the list updated.

Good luck out there
