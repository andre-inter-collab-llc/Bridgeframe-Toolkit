# CAREER OVERVIEW

I'm a public health professional with close to two decades of diverse experience spanning epidemiology, data science, health informatics, and mental health care. My background uniquely combines psychology and mental health support with technical expertise, enabling me to better understand user needs when implementing technical solutions across diverse communities.\

I've worked across local, state, federal, tribal, and international health systems, gaining substantial experience in both private and public sector environments. My experience ranges from establishing global surveillance systems to implementing local health interventions in resource-constrained settings. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I developed contact tracing systems and automated workflows that increased efficiency and improved health outcomes. As a Health Scientist at CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, I pioneered integration of artificial intelligence into public health workflows while leading global antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems across multiple continents, demonstrating the transformative impact of modern data science approaches on international public health challenges.
