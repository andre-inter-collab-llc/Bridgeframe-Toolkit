# Bridging Business Analysis and Public Health Analysis: A Shared Process Perspective

## Introduction

Business analysts and public health analysts might work in different contexts, but they share a common mission: using data and stakeholder input to solve problems and deliver value or impact. In the business world, **business analysis** is defined as *“the practice of enabling change in the context of an organization by defining needs and recommending solutions that deliver value to stakeholders”*[\[1\]](https://www.iiba.org/professional-development/knowledge-centre/articles/needs-and-solutions/#:~:text=far%2C%20%27business%20analysis%27%20is%20the,only%20clear%20example). Similarly, **public health analysis** involves researching health issues, analyzing data for patterns and trends, and developing solutions to improve community health outcomes[\[2\]](https://www.coursera.org/articles/public-health-analyst#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20public%20health,analysis). In practice, a public health analyst might gather and interpret epidemiological data, then work with communities to implement programs that improve health and efficiency[\[3\]](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/what-does-public-health-analyst-do#:~:text=may%20conduct%20outreach%20activities%20by,duties%20of%20public%20health%20analysts) – much like a business analyst uses data insights to recommend process improvements or product features for better business results[\[4\]](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/microsoft-business-analyst#:~:text=That%20is%209,1). Both roles act as change agents, guiding evidence-based decisions in their domains.

This article will walk through the typical **business analyst (BA) process** – from needs assessment through solution design to evaluation – and map each step to its **public health analysis** counterpart. We will translate key terminology (for example, what *“user stories”* mean in a public health context) and compare the tools used in business analysis with analogous tools used in public health. The goal is to help technical professionals and public health professionals understand each other’s approaches, using plain language and internationally relevant examples.

*(Note: We avoid jargon and U.S.-centric assumptions so that readers from any country can relate. Terms are explained in simple language, and we provide a reference table mapping common BA and public health terms and tools.)*

## Needs Assessment: Identifying the Problem or Need

**In business analysis, the first step is often a needs assessment** – understanding the core business problem or opportunity. A BA begins by collecting information about the current state of the organization or process, researching industry context, and identifying pain points[\[5\]](https://www.whizlabs.com/blog/business-analysis-process/#:~:text=1)[\[6\]](https://www.whizlabs.com/blog/business-analysis-process/#:~:text=a%20project%20is%20based,strategic%20approach%20for%20a%20project). For example, a BA might conduct a SWOT analysis or review performance data to pinpoint a decline in customer retention that needs addressing. This stage defines the *business need* or opportunity that the project will tackle. As the International Institute of Business Analysis (IIBA) notes, needs are a central concept: they represent the issues to be solved or objectives to be achieved for value to be delivered[\[7\]](https://www.iiba.org/professional-development/knowledge-centre/articles/needs-and-solutions/#:~:text=Six%20core%20concepts%20form%20the,until%20all%20six%20are%20understood)[\[1\]](https://www.iiba.org/professional-development/knowledge-centre/articles/needs-and-solutions/#:~:text=far%2C%20%27business%20analysis%27%20is%20the,only%20clear%20example).

**In public health, a comparable step is conducting a health needs assessment** (often part of a community health assessment). Public health analysts and planners gather data on community health status, identify gaps or emerging health problems, and set priorities. This could involve analyzing epidemiological data (e.g. disease incidence, mortality rates) and community input to determine what the most pressing health needs are. According to the U.S. CDC, most public health assessment frameworks include phases to *“conduct community health assessment(s) \[and\] prioritize health issues,”* usually after organizing a team and engaging the community[\[8\]](https://www.cdc.gov/public-health-gateway/php/public-health-strategy/public-health-strategies-for-community-health-assessment-models-frameworks-tools.html#:~:text=1,Evaluate%20process%20and%20outcomes). For example, a health department might perform a survey to discover a high rate of diabetes in a region – indicating a need for better nutrition and exercise programs.

Despite the different contexts, **both BAs and public health analysts start by asking “What problem are we trying to solve?”** They use data to identify needs: a BA might frame it as a business problem (e.g. *“sales are dropping in region X”*), while a public health analyst frames it as a public health issue (e.g. *“increase in type 2 diabetes among adults”*). Both will quantify the baseline situation and build a case for addressing it. Importantly, both fields emphasize defining the need clearly before jumping to solutions – ensuring any intervention is grounded in actual evidence of a gap or problem.

## Stakeholder Engagement: Involving the Right People

Once the need is identified, **both business and public health analysts engage stakeholders** to gather insights and gain buy-in. In business analysis, stakeholders include anyone with an interest or influence in the project – for instance, business owners, end users, customers, IT staff, and regulators. A BA will identify these stakeholders early[\[9\]](https://www.whizlabs.com/blog/business-analysis-process/#:~:text=2) and understand their perspectives and requirements. Techniques like stakeholder maps or a RACI matrix help pinpoint who should be involved and their level of influence[\[10\]](https://www.whizlabs.com/blog/business-analysis-process/#:~:text=,also%20included%20as%20vital%20stakeholders)[\[11\]](https://www.whizlabs.com/blog/business-analysis-process/#:~:text=,stakeholder%20list%20for%20a%20project). Engaging stakeholders might involve workshops, interviews, and regular communications to ensure their needs are heard. Effective **stakeholder engagement** builds consensus and uncovers requirements that the analyst might otherwise miss. It’s also key for change management – if people feel heard and involved, they are more likely to support the solution.

**Public health analysis similarly requires broad stakeholder engagement**, though the stakeholders can be quite diverse: community members, local health workers, hospital administrators, government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and sometimes international partners. Public health initiatives often stress *community engagement and collaboration*. In fact, most public health planning models emphasize the importance of **including the community’s voice** and multi-sector partners in every stage[\[12\]](https://www.cdc.gov/public-health-gateway/php/public-health-strategy/public-health-strategies-for-community-health-assessment-models-frameworks-tools.html#:~:text=Most%20tools%20emphasize%20the%20importance,resources%20and%20frequently%20used%20models). For example, when designing a new maternal health program, a public health analyst might convene focus groups of mothers, consult local clinics, and coordinate with NGOs – analogous to how a BA might gather input from end-user focus groups and department heads for a new software product. The CDC notes that successful community health improvement plans hinge on strong community engagement and partnerships[\[13\]](https://www.cdc.gov/public-health-gateway/php/public-health-strategy/public-health-strategies-for-community-health-assessment-models-frameworks-tools.html#:~:text=Mobilizing%20for%20Action%20through%20Planning,Officials%20and%20CDC%2C%20updated%202023)[\[14\]](https://www.cdc.gov/public-health-gateway/php/public-health-strategy/public-health-strategies-for-community-health-assessment-models-frameworks-tools.html#:~:text=,after%20identifying%20assets%20and%20needs).

While the term *“stakeholder”* is used in both fields, the types of stakeholders differ. A **business analyst** working on a new product might talk about *users, product managers, developers,* and *executives*. A **public health analyst** might refer to *community leaders, target population groups, healthcare providers,* and *policy-makers* as stakeholders. In both cases, the analyst serves as a facilitator who listens to different perspectives and navigates any conflicting priorities. Both also share the challenge of communicating in ways each audience can understand – translating technical or medical jargon into plain language for non-experts, and vice versa. By ensuring that stakeholders are engaged early and often, both BAs and public health analysts set the stage for solutions that are accepted and effective.

## Requirement Gathering: Eliciting What’s Needed

With needs identified and stakeholders on board, the next step is to **gather detailed requirements** for a solution. In classic business analysis, this is the phase of *requirements elicitation* and documentation. A business analyst uses various techniques – stakeholder interviews, workshops, surveys, observations, and prototyping – to uncover what is required to solve the problem. They document these needs as *business requirements*, *functional requirements*, or in agile contexts as *user stories*. A **user story** is a simple, one-sentence requirement from the user’s perspective (e.g. *“As a customer, I want to track my order status online so that I know when my delivery will arrive.”*). User stories are a key tool in software projects to define features in terms of user value[\[15\]](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/microsoft-business-analyst#:~:text=,Requirements%20Elicitation)[\[16\]](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/microsoft-business-analyst#:~:text=,Business%20Process%20Modeling). Whether via formal requirement documents or an agile backlog, the BA ensures all necessary capabilities and criteria for success are captured. For example, if a BA is designing a new inventory system, a requirement might be *“the system must send an alert when any item stock falls below its reorder level.”*

**Public health projects also require gathering requirements, though the term “requirements” might be translated into “objectives” or “specifications” depending on context.** For instance, if the public health need is a high rate of diabetes, the *requirements* might be the elements needed in a program to reduce that rate – such as a dietary education component, an exercise component, training for local clinicians, and a data system to track participants’ health metrics. Public health analysts often set **SMART objectives** (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) which function similarly to requirements by clearly stating what the intervention should achieve (e.g. *“By next year, increase the percentage of adults engaging in 150 minutes of exercise per week by 20%”*). If the project involves building or adapting a technology (say, a disease surveillance database), the analyst would gather system requirements from end-users (health officials, data managers) much like a BA would – what data fields are needed, what reports should be generated, etc. In essence, **public health requirement gathering means defining the critical components and criteria for success of a health intervention or system.** This can involve community assessments, reviewing scientific evidence (to see what interventions work), and consulting subject-matter experts.

**Translating terminology:** A good example of terminology translation is comparing *“user stories”* in tech with their public health equivalent. Public health professionals may not write “user stories” in agile format, but they do create **use case scenarios** or **personas** to guide program design. For instance, a public health team might develop a *persona* like *“Persona: Maria, a 45-year-old with diabetes who lives in a rural village – she needs affordable access to healthy foods and weekly support meetings to manage her condition.”* This persona encapsulates requirements for an intervention (improving food access and providing support groups). Likewise, a **use case scenario** in public health might describe how a community health worker would use a new mobile app to report cases from the field – analogous to a user story describing how an end-user interacts with a software feature. Both approaches center on the end-users’ needs: the BA’s user story is essentially a requirement tied to a user benefit, and the public health persona or scenario ensures programs are human-centered and contextually relevant. The language differs, but the goal is the same: understand what the *users* or *target population* need the solution to do.

During requirement gathering, both roles produce artifacts that guide the next stages. A business analyst might produce a **Business Requirements Document (BRD)** or a backlog of well-defined user stories. A public health analyst might produce a **project plan or grant proposal section** outlining program components and targets, or a **logic model** diagram that maps inputs \-\> activities \-\> outputs \-\> outcomes. These serve as blueprints for designing the solution. Notably, both fields value clarity and evidence at this stage – every requirement or objective should connect back to the need identified, and stakeholders should agree that these requirements, if met, would indeed address the problem.

## Solution Design: Crafting the Intervention or Solution

With clear requirements or objectives in hand, the focus shifts to **designing a solution**. In business analysis (especially in product or system development), *solution design* involves creating models, specifications, or prototypes for how to fulfill the requirements. This could mean drafting process flow diagrams, wireframes for a new app, or specifying the data model for a database. A business analyst often works closely with solution architects, designers, or developers in this phase – ensuring the design meets the requirements and is feasible. For example, if a requirement is to “reduce manual data entry,” the BA might design a workflow that integrates two software systems via an API, eliminating duplicate data entry. Solution design in BA is about translating *what* needs to be done into *how* it will be done in terms of business processes or system functionality. The BA may not do the technical design (coding, etc.) but will create detailed **functional designs** or process improvements recommendations that developers or process owners then implement[\[17\]](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/microsoft-business-analyst#:~:text=,gathering%20techniques)[\[18\]](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/microsoft-business-analyst#:~:text=,data%20preparation%2C%20analysis%2C%20and%20visualization). Tools like flowchart software (Visio, Lucidchart) or UML diagrams are common to visualize the future-state process or system. Throughout this stage, the BA ensures that the solution being designed traces back to the requirements – a concept known as **requirements traceability** – so nothing critical is overlooked.

**In public health, solution design equates to designing the public health intervention or program.** Based on the identified needs and objectives, public health professionals will devise a program strategy or policy change. This could involve selecting evidence-based interventions or tailoring a new approach for the community. For instance, if the need is to improve vaccination rates, the solution design might include establishing mobile vaccination clinics, an education campaign, and perhaps a reminder system via SMS for patients – each of these are “components” of the designed solution. Public health analysts will consider the resources required, the cultural context, and any existing frameworks. They might use tools like **program logic models** (which map inputs, activities, outputs, and outcomes) or draw on frameworks like the WHO’s planning models for health interventions. In many ways, a logic model is analogous to a business analyst’s process flow: it visually ensures that what you plan to do will logically lead to the desired outcomes. Public health solution design also often involves **policy design** (if changes in regulations or guidelines are part of the solution) and planning for operational details (locations, staff roles, timelines for a health campaign).

Another parallel in solution design is **human-centered design** and innovation methods, which both fields increasingly use. Business analysts might conduct design thinking workshops to ideate creative solutions that meet user needs. Public health teams similarly use human-centered design, involving community members in co-creating interventions that will work in their context. For example, in designing a health education app for a low-literacy population, a public health analyst might prototype simple icon-based interfaces and get feedback from community health workers – akin to a BA prototyping a user interface and getting user feedback before development.

Throughout solution design, **there’s a translation of requirements into concrete plans or specifications.** A key terminology crossover: business analysts talk about *“solutions”* (which could be a new software system, a redesigned process, or a product feature), while public health folks might talk about *“interventions”* or *“programs.”* In essence, both are the **planned set of actions or tools to address the identified need.** By the end of this stage, a business analyst might have a documented solution design (e.g. user interface mockups, system requirement specifications, process maps) ready for implementation. A public health analyst would have a program plan or intervention design (e.g. curriculum for a workshop, protocol for a vaccination drive, design of a new data reporting system for clinics) ready to be rolled out. Both will also set **success criteria** at this point – e.g. business KPIs or public health indicators that the solution aims to improve, which will be measured later on.

## Testing and Implementation: From Pilot to Launch

Once a solution is designed, it’s time to put it into action – carefully. In the business analysis realm, after developers build a system or changes are made, the BA often plays a role in **testing** to ensure the solution meets the requirements. This can include reviewing test plans, conducting user acceptance testing (UAT) with end users, and verifying that all features function as expected. The idea is to catch any issues before full deployment. For example, if the project was implementing a new CRM software, the BA might coordinate a UAT session with sales reps to make sure the system works for them and tweak anything necessary. Testing isn’t just technical bug fixing; it’s validating that the solution truly solves the original business need. After testing, **implementation** means rolling out the solution to the live environment or the broader organization. A BA often helps with the go-live planning, training users, and developing user manuals or training materials. Change management is crucial here: BAs help stakeholders adapt to new processes or systems, addressing concerns and ensuring a smooth transition. Implementation in business might be a big bang launch on a certain date, or a phased rollout (e.g. department by department, or a soft launch to a small user group first). In agile environments, “implementation” is continuous as incremental features are released in sprints, but even then, major changes often see a pilot group or phased introduction.

**Public health implementation shares many of these principles, often with even greater emphasis on caution and piloting.** When a public health intervention is ready to launch, analysts will frequently start with a **pilot program** – a small-scale implementation to test the approach in practice. For example, if a new community health worker protocol is designed to improve diabetes care, they might pilot it in one district for 6 months before expanding region-wide. This mirrors the idea of UAT/pilot in business projects: working out kinks on a small scale and gathering feedback. Public health pilots help ensure the intervention is culturally appropriate, feasible in the local setting, and actually produces the intended outputs. Any issues (whether logistical, acceptability, or unexpected outcomes) can be addressed by refining the program design. Public health literature often refers to this as **“implementation science”** – studying how to best implement and scale interventions in real-world settings, which is akin to a BA analyzing user feedback during a software pilot and refining requirements.

After a successful pilot, **full implementation in public health** means scaling up the program to the target population or area. This may involve training additional staff (just as a BA would train more users), securing resources (budget, supplies), and establishing partnerships or policy support if needed. For instance, rolling out a vaccination campaign might require coordinating with clinics across a country, setting up data reporting systems (maybe using an open-source tool like DHIS2 for tracking, more on tools later), and running public awareness efforts. Throughout implementation, public health analysts monitor the process – similar to how in business a BA might monitor initial adoption rates or user satisfaction. Both types of analysts need to be adept at **problem-solving on the fly** during implementation: maybe a technical issue arises in the software, or a community resistance issue emerges in the health program. Adjustments are made in real time to keep the implementation on track.

Terminology-wise, where a business analyst might speak of *“go-live”* or *“deployment”*, a public health professional might say *“program rollout”* or *“scaling up the intervention.”* Both mean taking the solution from concept to reality. Another cross-domain translation: the concept of **“change management”** in business – preparing people and processes for a change – is very similar to **“community engagement and buy-in”** in public health implementation. In both cases, success depends on the people involved embracing the new way. For example, a BA implementing a new workflow must ensure employees understand and accept it; a public health analyst implementing a new health practice must ensure local health workers and community members support it. The human factor is paramount in both contexts.

## Impact Evaluation: Measuring Results and Value

After implementation, both business and public health analysts turn to an essential question: **Did the solution work?** This is the evaluation phase – measuring outcomes against the original goals or needs. In business analysis, this often involves assessing **key performance indicators (KPIs)** or other metrics to see if the project delivered the expected business value. For instance, if the need was to reduce customer churn by 10%, did the new solution achieve that? A BA might compare sales or customer retention data from before and after the implementation, run user satisfaction surveys, or calculate the return on investment (ROI). This stage is sometimes called **solution evaluation** or **benefits realization** in BA terms[\[4\]](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/microsoft-business-analyst#:~:text=That%20is%209,1). It’s about closing the loop: ensuring the effort actually produced tangible improvements and learning from the outcomes. If a project fell short, the BA might analyze why – were requirements incomplete, was adoption lower than expected, or did external factors play a role? These insights inform future projects. Many organizations conduct a **post-implementation review** where business analysts document lessons learned and recommendations. For example, a BA might report that a new process automation saved 500 hours of staff time per month and increased data accuracy by 30%, highlighting both the success and any remaining issues to address.

**In public health, evaluation is a well-defined part of any program – often termed Monitoring and Evaluation (M\&E).** Public health analysts will measure health outcomes and impacts to see if the intervention achieved its public health goals. This might involve epidemiological analysis (e.g. did the incidence of the target disease drop?), process indicators (e.g. how many people were reached by the program, how many workshops were held), and even economic evaluation (like cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit analysis, especially for large programs or policy changes). The CDC’s public health improvement frameworks always include a phase to *“evaluate process and outcomes”*[\[19\]](https://www.cdc.gov/public-health-gateway/php/public-health-strategy/public-health-strategies-for-community-health-assessment-models-frameworks-tools.html#:~:text=3,Evaluate%20process%20and%20outcomes). For example, if a maternal health intervention was rolled out, the evaluation might track changes in maternal mortality or morbidity rates over a few years, along with qualitative feedback from participants on how the program helped them. Public health often distinguishes between **process evaluation** (did we execute the program as planned? did it reach the intended audience?) and **outcome evaluation** (did we achieve the desired health outcomes?).

**Both fields share the practice of making evidence-based conclusions** at this stage. A successful outcome in business might be framed as *“X% increase in revenue”* or *“process time cut by half,”* whereas in public health it might be *“Y% reduction in disease incidence”* or *“improved health behavior in the community (as measured by surveys).”* If results are positive, it validates the approach – and those successes should be communicated to stakeholders (just as a BA would present a success case to executives, a public health analyst will report to funders, community, and policymakers to demonstrate impact). If results are mixed or negative, both will consider adjustments: maybe the solution needs a tweak or additional features; in public health, maybe the intervention needs adaptation or there were implementation barriers to address.

It’s worth noting that timelines for evaluation can differ. Business projects might measure outcomes within weeks or months (especially if tied to quarterly results), while public health outcomes (like reducing chronic disease rates) can take longer to materialize and measure, sometimes years. However, both often collect **early indicators** to gauge if things are on the right track. For example, a BA might look at user engagement metrics right after a software launch as a leading indicator of future ROI, just as a public health analyst might look at intermediate outcomes (like % of people attending program sessions) as indicators of eventual health impact.

Finally, both types of analysts use the evaluation phase as an opportunity for **continuous improvement and cross-disciplinary learning**. A business analyst might incorporate user feedback to plan the next software update. A public health analyst might use findings to refine the program model and share lessons in a report or academic paper. The end of one cycle often feeds into the beginning of the next needs assessment – creating a virtuous cycle of improvement. In public health, this is often formalized in the program cycle; in business, it aligns with iterative development and business process improvement practices.

## Mapping Tools and Terminology: Business Analysis vs Public Health Analysis

While the processes align closely, each field has its own **terminology and tools** of the trade. Bridging the two requires a bit of “translation.” Below is a table mapping common business analysis terms and tools to their nearest equivalents in public health analysis:

| Business Analysis | Public Health Analysis |
| :---- | :---- |
| *Business Need* (Problem to solve) | *Health Need* / Public Health Issue (e.g. disease burden or service gap) |
| *Stakeholders* (e.g. project sponsor, end users, customers) | *Stakeholders* (e.g. community members, health agencies, local leaders) |
| *Requirements* (business/system requirements) | *Objectives* or *Criteria* (e.g. program objectives, health targets to meet) |
| *User Stories* (Agile format requirements) | *Use Case Scenarios* or *Personas* (descriptions of target user needs in health context) |
| *Solution Design* (proposed system or process design) | *Intervention/Program Design* (planned public health intervention strategy) |
| *Testing* (e.g. User Acceptance Testing) | *Pilot Testing* (small-scale trial of the program or system) |
| *Implementation* (Rollout/Go-live of solution) | *Program Implementation* (Rollout of health intervention in the community) |
| *Impact Evaluation* (assess business outcomes, value delivered) | *Outcome Evaluation* (assess health outcomes, program impact – part of M\&E) |

In addition to conceptual terms, there are parallels in **tools and software** used by BAs and public health analysts. Business analysts commonly use certain software for project management, data analysis, and collaboration – and there are public health-oriented (often open-source or free) counterparts that serve similar purposes:

| Business Analyst Tool | Public Health Relevant Tool |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Jira** (issue and task tracking system) | **Trello** or similar free Kanban boards for tracking tasks (project management on a budget) |
| **Miro** (online whiteboard for collaboration) | **Participatory workshops** or free whiteboard apps (e.g. Google Jamboard) to brainstorm and map out community processes |
| **Power BI / Tableau** (business intelligence and data visualization software) | **DHIS2** (open-source health data management & dashboard platform)[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHIS2#:~:text=DHIS2%20,of%20the%20world%E2%80%99s%20population); **R** statistical software for data analysis (free)[\[21\]](https://www.r-project.org/#:~:text=R%3A%20The%20R%20Project%20for,UNIX%20platforms%2C%20Windows%20and%20MacOS); **QGIS** for mapping spatial health data (free GIS tool)[\[22\]](https://software.stanford.edu/software/qgis-desktop#:~:text=QGIS%20is%20a%20free%20and,and%20analysis%20of%20geospatial%20data) |
| **Asana** (project and task management app) | **Trello** (free version for task management) or even spreadsheets for simple project tracking, which are commonly used in resource-limited health projects |
| *(Various BA prototyping/modeling tools)* – e.g. Visio, Lucidchart, etc. | **REDCap** for data capture in research (free for nonprofits)[\[23\]](https://project-redcap.org/#:~:text=REDCap%20is%20a%20secure%20web,page%20to%20learn%20how%20your); paper-based mapping tools for community planning (in low-tech environments) |

A few of these public health tools deserve special mention. **DHIS2** (District Health Information Software 2\) is a free, open-source platform widely used in over 70 countries as a national health information system[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHIS2#:~:text=DHIS2%20,of%20the%20world%E2%80%99s%20population). It allows health analysts to collect data (like clinic reports), create dashboards, and map disease trends – essentially playing a similar role that enterprise BI tools (or even custom IT systems) play in business settings, but tailored for health indicators. **REDCap** (Research Electronic Data Capture) is another popular free tool (for non-profits) that public health analysts use to design surveys and databases for health studies[\[23\]](https://project-redcap.org/#:~:text=REDCap%20is%20a%20secure%20web,page%20to%20learn%20how%20your). A business analyst might not use REDCap, but they might use commercial survey tools or custom databases; the analogy is that REDCap provides a non-technical way to build data collection forms, much like a BA might use Google Forms or a CRM’s form builder to gather data. **R** is an open-source statistical programming language widely used by public health data analysts (and increasingly by business data analysts too) – it’s an alternative to proprietary tools like SAS or to the drag-and-drop visuals of Power BI/Tableau, providing powerful analysis capabilities for those with coding skills[\[21\]](https://www.r-project.org/#:~:text=R%3A%20The%20R%20Project%20for,UNIX%20platforms%2C%20Windows%20and%20MacOS). And **QGIS** is the open-source equivalent of GIS mapping software (like ArcGIS) and is extensively used in epidemiology and environmental health to visualize data geographically[\[22\]](https://software.stanford.edu/software/qgis-desktop#:~:text=QGIS%20is%20a%20free%20and,and%20analysis%20of%20geospatial%20data) (for example, mapping disease outbreak locations or healthcare service coverage).

Business analysts, on the other hand, often rely on commercial platforms: **Jira** for managing requirements and software development tasks (especially in Agile teams), **Confluence** or SharePoint for documentation, **Asana** or **Microsoft Project** for project plans, and **Tableau/Power BI** for analyzing business metrics. When collaborating with public health teams, BAs might introduce some of these tools to improve efficiency (for instance, using Trello or Asana to manage a health project’s tasks instead of email chains). Conversely, public health professionals can explore the open-source tools mentioned to avoid high licensing costs and to leverage tools built for their context (e.g. DHIS2’s ability to handle health facility data offline in remote areas is a big plus).

The key takeaway is that **neither field is constrained by a lack of tools – it’s often a matter of choosing the right tool for the context and budget.** A public health analyst working with limited resources might not afford a Tableau license, but they can use DHIS2 or R (which are free) to analyze data and create visualizations. Likewise, a business analyst working in a health context should be aware that public health agencies have their own data systems (like DHIS2 or national health databases) and be prepared to interface with those instead of assuming a standard enterprise system. By understanding each other’s toolkits, BAs and public health analysts can share tips – for example, a BA could learn basic QGIS to help a health department with mapping, while a public health analyst could pick up Excel Power Query or Power BI skills to analyze program data more efficiently[\[24\]](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/handan-derin_flowchart-maker-and-online-diagram-software-activity-7377194395663699968-ZLmN#:~:text=pulling%20data%20directly%20from%20sources,DevOps%20Awareness%20Understand%20how%20development).

## Professional Development: Learning Resources for Analysts in Both Fields

Both business analysis and public health analysis are evolving fields that require continuous learning. Fortunately, there are plenty of online resources and training opportunities. Below we highlight some recommended **learning resources** for each profession, including internationally accessible courses:

**For Business Analysts (Technology/Product domain):**  
\- **Microsoft Business Analyst Professional Certificate (Coursera)** – A comprehensive beginner-to-intermediate program created by Microsoft, covering key BA skills like requirements analysis, process modeling, data analysis, and the use of tools like Excel and Power BI[\[17\]](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/microsoft-business-analyst#:~:text=,gathering%20techniques)[\[15\]](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/microsoft-business-analyst#:~:text=,Requirements%20Elicitation). This certificate is designed to be completed in a few months and even prepares learners for industry certification exams, making it a solid foundation for aspiring BAs.  
\- **IIBA’s Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (BABOK) Guide and Certifications** – The International Institute of Business Analysis offers the BABOK guide (a foundational book outlining BA best practices) and certifications (ECBA, CCBA, CBAP) that are recognized globally. Studying the BABOK or taking IIBA-endorsed courses can help a BA formalize their knowledge in needs assessment, elicitation techniques, stakeholder management, and more.  
\- **Business Analysis courses on Coursera and LinkedIn Learning** – Apart from the Microsoft certificate, courses like *“Business Analysis Fundamentals”* on Coursera or various **LinkedIn Learning** paths provide targeted training on topics such as creating requirement documents, process mapping, and agile methodologies for BAs. These are useful for continuous learning or brushing up specific skills (for example, learning JIRA usage or data visualization basics for analysts).  
*(Additionally, those interested in data-centric roles might consider the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, which overlaps with some analysis and visualization skills relevant to business analysts[\[25\]](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=healthcare%20data%20analytics#:~:text=Free%20Trial)[\[26\]](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=healthcare%20data%20analytics#:~:text=Google%20Data%20Analytics).)*

**For Public Health Analysts (Data/Analytics/Informatics domain):**  
\- **Foundations of Public Health Practice Specialization (Coursera)** – Offered by Imperial College London, this specialization covers the core principles of public health practice[\[27\]\[28\]](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=public%20health&topic=Health#:~:text=Imperial%20College%20London). It spans foundational topics from epidemiology and health promotion to health protection. It’s great for public health professionals seeking to ground themselves in broad public health concepts and is accessible online worldwide.  
\- **Epidemiology in Public Health Practice Specialization (Coursera)** – Provided by Johns Hopkins University, this series of courses teaches applied epidemiology and data analysis in public health contexts[\[29\]](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=public%20health&topic=Health#:~:text=Johns%20Hopkins%20University)[\[30\]](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=public%20health&topic=Health#:~:text=Beginner%20%C2%B7%20Specialization%20%C2%B7%203,6%20Months). It’s hands-on with analyzing public health data (including some GIS and biostatistics skills) and is highly rated by learners globally. This is an excellent way for analysts to strengthen their ability to interpret health data and investigate health trends.  
\- **Health Informatics Specialization (Coursera)** – Johns Hopkins also offers a *Health Informatics* specialization[\[31\]](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=healthcare%20data%20analytics#:~:text=Johns%20Hopkins%20University) that focuses on managing health information systems, electronic health records, and the intersection of IT and public health. Public health analysts interested in digital solutions (like surveillance systems or data integration) will benefit from understanding clinical informatics, data standards, and project management in health IT[\[32\]](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=healthcare%20data%20analytics#:~:text=Health%20Informatics). (The University of Minnesota and others also have similar health informatics online programs; many concepts overlap with business analysis in IT projects.)  
\- **Data Science for Public Health** – There are several programs under this umbrella. One example is the *Data Science for Health Research* specialization (University of Michigan) which teaches using R for health data analysis[\[33\]](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-for-health-research#:~:text=In%20Data%20Science%20for%20Health,within%20the%20public%20health%20field)[\[34\]](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-for-health-research#:~:text=1,style%20videos). Another is the **“Statistical Analysis with R for Public Health”** course by Imperial College[\[35\]](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=public%20health&topic=Health#:~:text=Imperial%20College%20London). These courses equip public health analysts with modern data science skills, crucial for handling large datasets, performing predictive modeling, or using machine learning on health data.  
\- **OpenWHO and Other Global Health Online Courses** – The WHO’s OpenWHO platform offers free courses on health topics (including data collection during outbreaks, health information management, etc.) that are accessible in multiple languages. For instance, OpenWHO has courses on COVID-19 data, Ebola surveillance, and other timely topics – useful for public health analysts who need to quickly get up to speed on specific areas. Similarly, organizations like the Public Health Informatics Institute (PHII) and CDC provide resources or training toolkits (often free) on things like public health data modernization and informatics, which are globally relevant as countries strengthen their health data systems.  
\- **Specialized Training and MOOCs** – Beyond Coursera, platforms like edX and FutureLearn have relevant courses (e.g. *“Global Health Informatics”* on edX, or *“Public Health Data Science”* modules). Also, many universities (like University of Geneva or University of Melbourne) offer online certificates in global health or public health research methods that analysts anywhere can enroll in. For example, the University of North Carolina’s *“Epidemiology: The Basic Science of Public Health”* is a popular introductory MOOC[\[36\]](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=public%20health&topic=Health#:~:text=The%20University%20of%20North%20Carolina,at%20Chapel%20Hill). Public health analysts should choose based on their focus – whether it’s more epidemiology (disease data), biostatistics, GIS, or informatics – as each of these sub-areas has tailored courses.

**Learning across disciplines:** It’s also worth noting that business analysts looking to work in health settings might benefit from some of the public health courses above to gain domain knowledge (e.g. learning epidemiology basics), and public health analysts can likewise benefit from business analysis training (e.g. learning project management and stakeholder interview techniques). For instance, a public health analyst taking the Microsoft BA certificate will gain skills in process improvement and stakeholder communication that are very applicable to public sector projects[\[17\]](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/microsoft-business-analyst#:~:text=,gathering%20techniques)[\[15\]](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/microsoft-business-analyst#:~:text=,Requirements%20Elicitation). Meanwhile, a business analyst taking a public health data course will better understand the kinds of data and metrics public health cares about (like incidence rates, population surveys, etc.) and how to analyze them. Given the increasing intersection of tech and health (for example, developing health apps or data systems), such cross-training can be incredibly valuable.

## Conclusion: Collaboration and Shared Learning

The alignment between the business analyst’s process and the public health analyst’s process is striking – both start with identifying needs, engage stakeholders, gather requirements (or objectives), design thoughtful solutions, implement carefully (often with pilots/tests), and evaluate the impact with data. The terminology might differ, but the analytical mindset and problem-solving approach are very much alike. This means there is a great opportunity for **collaboration and shared learning across these disciplines**.

Technical professionals (like BAs, IT analysts, data scientists) have much to offer public health in terms of methods for requirements gathering, agile project management, and efficient use of technology tools. At the same time, public health professionals bring deep expertise in community engagement, ethical considerations, and measuring human outcomes that can greatly enrich how solutions are designed and evaluated – lessons that are increasingly important even in the business world as we emphasize user-centric design and social impacts. By recognizing the common ground outlined above, BAs and public health analysts can more easily communicate and work together on interdisciplinary initiatives (such as health information system projects, digital health startups, or public sector service improvements).

In an international context, collaboration is key. Whether it’s a project to develop a health dashboard in Africa (where a BA might work with a Ministry of Health analyst using DHIS2) or a public-private partnership to implement a wellness program in Europe (where a public health team might coordinate with a consulting firm’s BAs), understanding each other’s frameworks and language prevents missteps. It ensures that technology solutions are relevant to public health needs, and that public health interventions are planned and executed with solid project discipline and innovation.

In closing, **let’s encourage ongoing exchange between business analysis and public health analysis**. Business analysts can adopt a public health lens of improving lives and communities, and public health analysts can leverage business analysis techniques for structure and efficiency. Both groups should feel empowered to reach out, ask questions, and learn from each other’s best practices – be it through joint trainings, conferences, or collaborative projects. By doing so, we not only advance our respective fields but also amplify our shared goal of positive change.

***Call to action:*** If you’re a business analyst, consider connecting with a public health professional to see how your skills might help on a health project (data visualization, process optimization, etc.), and if you’re in public health, don’t hesitate to engage colleagues with business/tech expertise when designing programs or systems. Together, through collaboration and shared learning, we can create solutions that are technically sound, user-friendly, and make a real difference in people’s lives around the world.

Let’s bridge the gap – the health of our projects and our communities will be all the better for it.
