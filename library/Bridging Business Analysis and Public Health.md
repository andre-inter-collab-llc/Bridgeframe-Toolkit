# **The Synthesis of Systems and Society: A Unified Framework for Business Analysis and Public Health Practice**

The global landscape of healthcare is undergoing a radical transformation driven by the integration of sophisticated information technology and the increasing demand for data-driven public health interventions. At the heart of this transformation are two pivotal roles: the Business Analyst (BA) and the Public Health Analyst (PHA). While these professions emerge from distinct historical lineages—one from the efficiency-driven world of corporate systems and the other from the outcome-oriented field of epidemiology and community health—their core objectives are remarkably congruent. Both roles function as essential bridges between complex data sets and actionable strategic decisions.1 However, as technical firms increasingly develop products for public health agencies, a significant friction has emerged, characterized by a lack of overlapping terminology and divergent methodologies of engagement.3 This report provides a comprehensive mapping of the professional landscape, aligning the rigorous standards of the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (BABOK) with the essential functions and frameworks of public health practice.

## **Strategy Analysis and the Foundations of Community Health Assessment**

The first phase of the business analysis lifecycle, Strategy Analysis, focuses on identifying the business need, analyzing the current state, and defining the future state.5 In the context of a public health professional, this phase is precisely mirrored by the "Community Health Assessment" and the initial step of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Program Evaluation Framework: "Assess the Context".6

In a technical environment, the business analyst begins by eliciting and documenting the business need—the problem or opportunity that justifies a change initiative.8 For the public health analyst, this "need" is often identified through the systematic evaluation of population health data, disease trends, and healthcare delivery gaps.1 The awkward encounters between these teams often begin here; a tech firm may approach a problem looking for a "Business Case," while the public health team is focused on "Health Equity" or "Social Determinants of Health".9

| Strategy Element | Business Analysis Terminology | Public Health Alignment | Conceptual Outcome |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Driver for Change** | Business Need 8 | Public Health Challenge 1 | Identification of the core issue requiring intervention. |
| **Current Baseline** | Current State Analysis 5 | Community Health Assessment 6 | Documentation of existing health outcomes and service gaps. |
| **Target Vision** | Future State Definition 5 | Programmatic Goals / Intended Outcomes 11 | Definition of success in terms of population health improvement. |
| **Constraint Analysis** | External Constraints | Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) 9 | Understanding the environmental factors influencing success. |

A profound second-order insight in this alignment is that while the business analyst assesses "Enterprise Limitations" to determine if an organization can implement a solution, the public health analyst assesses "Evaluation Capacity" and "Readiness" to determine if a community can sustain an intervention.5 The BA must learn that in public health, a "competitor" might actually be a "complementary program" or a "stakeholder" with overlapping jurisdiction.7 The terminology must shift from "Market Analysis" to "Contextual Assessment" to gain the trust of health professionals who view their work through the lens of mission-driven service rather than profit-driven efficiency.10

## **Business Analysis Planning and Monitoring: Governing the Public Health Lifecycle**

Once the strategy is defined, the business analyst moves into "Planning and Monitoring," which involves determining the governance framework, information management approach, and project methodology.5 This is where the clash of "Agile" and "Waterfall" methodologies becomes most apparent. Tech companies frequently favor Agile—an iterative, sprint-based approach focusing on rapid feedback and continuous delivery.3 Conversely, public health teams often operate within "Waterfall" or highly structured environments due to stringent regulatory requirements (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR), long-term grant funding cycles, and the need for absolute precision in clinical data.4

The Waterfall model’s linear progression provides the "Clarity," "Structure," and "Traceability" required for public health accreditation and government procurement initiatives.6 However, its rigidity can be a disadvantage in dynamic environments like infectious disease surveillance where requirements evolve rapidly.4 Agile’s flexibility can enhance collaboration between developers and clinicians, yet it requires a higher level of stakeholder engagement than many public health professionals—overburdened by administrative duties—can provide.3

| Feature | Agile Paradigm | Waterfall Paradigm | Public Health Context |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Cadence** | Iterative "Sprints" 13 | Sequential "Phases" 3 | Health programs often follow annual fiscal grant cycles.16 |
| **Documentation** | Just-in-time / Minimalist 14 | Upfront / Comprehensive 14 | Regulatory compliance demands high traceability.14 |
| **Feedback** | Continuous stakeholder loops 15 | Milestone-based reviews 3 | Clinicians have limited time for daily stand-ups.17 |
| **Risk Management** | Early identification through failure 15 | Mitigation during planning 4 | Low tolerance for error in clinical settings.14 |

To find common ground, the business analyst should frame "Governance" as "Decision-Making Protocols" and "Information Management" as "Data Reporting Requirements".5 For a PHA, the term "Information Management" is often associated with the secure storage of sensitive patient data, whereas for a BA, it refers to the lifecycle of technical artifacts.2 Integrating these perspectives requires a hybrid approach where Agile iterations are utilized for user-interface design, while a Waterfall-like structure ensures the "Entry and Exit Criteria" for data security are met at every gate.18

## **Elicitation and Collaboration: Translating Interest Holder Needs**

The "Elicitation and Collaboration" phase in the BABOK guide involves the tasks performed to obtain information from stakeholders and confirm the results.5 In public health, this process is encapsulated in the "Engage Stakeholders" (or "Interest Holders") component of the CDC framework.7 A persistent issue in this phase is the BA's use of technical jargon. For instance, a BA might ask for "Business Rules," while a public health professional would more readily provide "Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)" or "Clinical Guidelines".18

The business analyst utilizes research, interviews, and workshops to build a shared understanding of requirements.5 Similarly, the public health analyst utilizes surveys, hospital records, and community health reports to identify needs.1 The BA must recognize that in public health, "Collaboration" extends beyond the internal team to include "Advocacy Groups," the "Medical Community," and the "General Public".10 The elicitation effort must therefore be "Culturally Sensitive" and "Evidence-Based".1

When confirming elicitation results, the BA should refrain from asking if the "User Stories" are accurate. Instead, they should ask if the "Service-User Scenarios" or "Programmatic Workflows" accurately reflect the patient journey.20 This subtle shift in language acknowledges the clinical and social reality of the health professional’s work, moving the conversation from a purely "System View" to a "Human-Centered View".20

## **Requirements Analysis and Design Definition: Bridging the "User Story" Gap**

The most significant linguistic hurdle in collaborative projects is the ubiquitous "User Story." In the tech world, this is a standard tool for describing functionality: *“As a \[User\], I want \[Action\], so that”*.22 Public health professionals often find this format confusing or reductive, as it fails to capture the complexity of clinical interactions and population-level impacts.24

To achieve the same results without the jargon, analysts should utilize alternatives that resonate with health practitioners. For example, "Service-User Scenarios" provide a narrative description of how a patient interacts with a health system, focusing on the "Assessment, Planning, Intervention, and Resolution" phases of care.21 Another powerful alternative is the "Goal-Problem-Solution (GPS)" format, which aligns perfectly with programmatic logic:

* **Goal**: The desired public health outcome (e.g., "Reduce tobacco use among youth").27  
* **Problem**: The current barrier or gap (e.g., "Lack of real-time monitoring of cessation programs").16  
* **Solution**: The proposed system feature or intervention (e.g., "A visual analytics portal for grantees").16

| Technical Requirement Tool | Public Health Alternative | Strategic Benefit |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **User Story** 22 | **Service-User Scenario** 21 | Provides clinical context and patient-centric focus. |
| **Job Story** 28 | **Situational Protocol** | Focuses on the *situation* rather than the *persona*. |
| **Acceptance Criteria** 22 | **Performance Indicators** 19 | Uses the language of evaluation and accreditation. |
| **Backlog Refinement** | **Work Plan Alignment** | Connects tasks to the programmatic mission. |
| **Persona** 20 | **Case Archetype** | Humanizes the user within a professional clinical framework. |

Another essential conceptual tool is the "SMART Guidelines" framework developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). This framework defines requirements as "Digital Adaptation Kits (L2)" and "Machine-Readable Software (L3)".19 By using the term "SMART Guidelines," the BA can bridge the gap between "Requirements Specifications" and "Evidence-Based Guidance".19 Furthermore, mapping these requirements through "Business Process Maps" or "Swimlane Charts" allows the health team to visualize how a new system integrates with existing "Models of Care".20

## **Requirements Life Cycle Management: Tracing Systems to Logic Models**

The "Requirements Life Cycle Management (RLCM)" knowledge area in the BABOK guide focuses on managing and maintaining requirements from inception to retirement.8 Its primary tasks include "Trace Requirements," "Maintain Requirements," and "Prioritize Requirements".8 In public health, this process is conceptually identical to the development and maintenance of a "Program Logic Model" or "Program Roadmap".11

A "Logic Model" is a visual depiction of the "If-Then" relationship between resources (inputs), activities, and outcomes.29 A business analyst can use the logic model to "Trace Requirements" by demonstrating how a specific software feature (an activity/output) leads to a short-term outcome, which in turn leads to a long-term public health impact.8 This provides a "Narrative Description" that helps stakeholders understand the "Plausibility" and "Feasibility" of the system.7

| RLCM Task | Public Health Equivalent | Practical Application |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Traceability** 8 | **Logic Modeling** 29 | Mapping system features to population health outcomes. |
| **Prioritization** 8 | **Benefit-Impact Analysis** | Selecting features that address the most urgent health threats. |
| **Change Assessment** 8 | **Evaluability Assessment** 7 | Determining if a change in policy requires a system update. |
| **Approval** 8 | **Consensus Building** | Securing buy-in from policymakers and health directors. |

The prioritization of requirements in public health must often follow the "MoSCoW Method" (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have) but within the context of "Regulatory Compliance" and "Data Security".14 A "Must-have" for a health analyst might be a "HIPAA-compliant data vault," which a technical BA might view as a "Non-functional Requirement" but which is, in fact, a "Strategic Prerequisite" for the health team.30

## **Solution Evaluation: Measuring Impact and Performance**

The final step in the business analysis process is "Solution Evaluation," where the analyst measures the actual value delivered by a solution.5 In the CDC framework, this is represented by "Gather Credible Evidence," "Generate Conclusions," and "Act on Findings".12 This phase uses statistical analysis and informatics to determine if the intervention was "Effective".1

For a public health analyst, this involves "Analysis and Modeling," using statistical programming (such as R or Python) and methodologies like "Interrupted Time Series (ITS) Analysis" to evaluate changes in trends following a program’s implementation.2 The business analyst can support this by ensuring the system captures the "Indicators" and "Metrics" necessary for evaluation.11

An insightful third-order observation is that while the BA looks for "Solution Limitations" within the software code, the PHA looks for "Enterprise Limitations" in the social context—such as "Health Disparities" or "Cultural Barriers"—that prevent the solution from achieving its intended value.5 Both professionals must become "Storytellers," using "Data Visualization" to translate numerical results into "Real-World Public Health Conclusions" for policymakers.2

## **Software Ecosystems: From Enterprise BI to Open Source Alternatives**

To facilitate these processes, both BAs and PHAs utilize a wide range of software tools. Business Intelligence (BI) software is particularly useful for public health surveillance, as it allows analysts to "centralize and operationalize" complex health data.30

### **Proprietary Business Intelligence and Analytics**

| Software Name | Best For in Public Health | Key Capability |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Microsoft Power BI** | Budget-friendly reporting 31 | Seamless integration with Excel and Azure.31 |
| **Tableau** | Interactive visual dashboards 31 | High-level data visualization for leadership.33 |
| **ArcGIS** | Spatiotemporal surveillance 34 | Mapping disease outbreaks and service gaps.2 |
| **Health Catalyst** | Population health analytics 31 | Specialized predictive modeling for clinical outcomes. |
| **Sisense** | Embedded analytics 33 | Blending robust analytics into existing health portals. |
| **Jira** | Project and requirement tracking 22 | Managing task backlogs and acceptance criteria. |

While these proprietary tools are powerful, public health teams often face budget constraints or require the transparency and control offered by "Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)".35

### **Free and Open Source Alternatives (FOSS)**

| Category | FOSS Alternative | Strategic Advantage |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **BI & Dashboards** | **Metabase** 37 | No-code interface for non-technical health staff.38 |
| **BI & Dashboards** | **Apache Superset** 37 | Cloud-native and capable of petabyte-scale analysis.38 |
| **Project Mgmt** | **OpenProject / Redmine** 35 | Supports both Agile and Waterfall workflows.35 |
| **Project Mgmt** | **Taiga / Plane** 39 | Lightweight, intuitive project tracking for small teams. |
| **Diagramming** | **Draw.io (diagrams.net)** 41 | Free alternative for flowcharts and swimlane charts. |
| **Database** | **PostgreSQL** 37 | Standard for secure, scalable health data storage.42 |
| **Stats / Science** | **R / Python / R Shiny** 2 | Universal tools for epidemiological modeling.43 |
| **GIS** | **QGIS** 2 | Comprehensive open-source spatial analysis. |

The transition from proprietary to FOSS tools, such as moving from "Lucidchart" to "Draw.io" or "Jira" to "Easy Redmine," can significantly reduce the "Tool Tax" while maintaining high standards of "Documentation and Traceability".35

## **Professional Development: Learning and Training Pathways**

Bridging the gap between the business analyst and the public health professional requires intentional cross-training. While the technical professional may pursue a "Microsoft Business Analyst Professional Certificate," the public health professional requires courses that blend data science with the core functions of public health.44

### **Targeted Learning Resources for Public Health Analysts**

| Course / Specialization | Institution | Focus Area |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Epidemiology in Public Health Practice** | Johns Hopkins (Coursera) | Trend analysis, GIS, and data visualization.44 |
| **Biostatistics in Public Health** | Johns Hopkins (Coursera) | Quantitative methods and statistical modeling.44 |
| **Statistical Analysis with R for Public Health** | Imperial College (Coursera) | Data wrangling and exploratory analysis in R.44 |
| **Public Health 101 Series** | CDC | Foundations of surveillance, informatics, and lab work.45 |
| **Health Informatics on FHIR** | Georgia Tech (edX) | Standards for health data interoperability.46 |
| **Inequality Monitoring in Health** | WHO | Methods for analyzing data from a health equity lens.47 |
| **Foundations of Healthcare Data Analytics** | AHIMA | Practical training in health data governance.48 |

For those entering the specialized world of outbreak forecasting, the CDC's Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics (CFA) provides resources on Bayesian inference strategies and software engineering best practices for public health.43 Additionally, the "OpenWHO" platform serves as a critical resource for "Emergency Response Frameworks" and "Mass Casualty Management," providing slides and videos that can be adapted for local community needs.49

## **Conclusion: A Unified Path Forward**

The awkward encounters between tech companies and public health teams are not an inevitable consequence of different missions, but rather a solvable challenge of communication and process integration. By mapping the BABOK guide’s knowledge areas to the CDC’s Program Evaluation Framework, professionals can see that their work follows a nearly identical trajectory.5

The technical business analyst must learn to "Assess the Context," respect the constraints of "Regulatory Compliance," and utilize "Service-User Scenarios" to ground their system designs in the reality of clinical care.7 Simultaneously, the public health professional must understand that the "Process of Business Analysis"—from "Strategy Analysis" to "Solution Evaluation"—is designed to ensure that the resources invested in a system result in a tangible, measurable "Public Health Impact".5

By embracing shared software tools—from proprietary BI to FOSS alternatives like Metabase and R—and engaging in cross-disciplinary training, these two roles can operate as a single, cohesive force.31 The future of public health depends on this synthesis: the ability to turn "Raw Information into Meaningful Action" through the combined rigor of systems analysis and health science.2 When terminology is aligned and methodologies are mapped, the resulting systems do more than just process data; they protect the health of entire populations.46
