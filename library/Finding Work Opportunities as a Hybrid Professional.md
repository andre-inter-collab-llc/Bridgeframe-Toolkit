# Finding Work Opportunities as a Hybrid Professional

Hybrid professionals – those fluent in public health, data science, and informatics – are in high demand, yet navigating the job market at this intersection can be challenging. This chapter offers practical guidance for job seekers on where to look for roles and consulting opportunities, and advice for organizations on attracting hybrid talent. We’ll cover community insights on the current landscape, concrete platforms and programs for finding work, strategic use of job search tools (like LinkedIn and Boolean Google searches), and even entrepreneurial pathways. The tone is plainspoken and pragmatic, with tips for both individuals and hiring organizations.

## The Hybrid Talent Gap: Insights from the Field

Public health agencies and programs increasingly recognize the need for hybrid skill sets (combining domain expertise with IT/data skills), but hiring and retaining such professionals isn’t straightforward. Community feedback highlights several realities:

* **High Demand, Limited Flexibility:** Many public health organizations urgently need data-savvy talent, yet they often can’t match private-sector salaries or offer flexible job designs. Rigid government pay scales and traditional job classifications make it hard to create attractive hybrid roles, even when the need is obvious. As one practitioner observed, organizations *“recognize the need but struggle to find candidates or justify positions that span traditional departmental boundaries”*[\[1\]](file://file_00000000ab707230a8ec40bd3ab75cc4#:~:text=The%20lack%20of%20skilled%20hybrid,that%20span%20traditional%20departmental%20boundaries).

* **Early-Career Foot in the Door:** For those just starting out, the best opportunities often come through **local or rural health departments** and **international NGOs**. These entry-level roles might not pay as much as tech jobs, but they offer rich hands-on experience. Running a small immunization registry in a rural county or supporting data collection for an NGO overseas can rapidly build your credibility as a hybrid professional. Many seasoned informaticians got their start in resource-limited settings where “doing it all” was part of the job description.

* **Advancing in Mid-Career and Beyond:** Mid-career and senior professionals can find higher-level hybrid positions in larger contexts. **State health departments**, major **hospital systems**, national **nonprofits**, **health tech companies**, **universities**, and **consulting firms** are increasingly hiring for roles that blend public health knowledge with data/IT expertise. These might be titles like *Informatics Manager*, *Health Data Scientist*, *Digital Health Program Lead*, or *Technical Advisor* – roles that leverage both programmatic experience and technical acumen. While these positions offer greater responsibility (and often better pay), they also expect you to lead teams and shape strategy, not just perform technical tasks.

**Tip for Organizations:** If you’re an employer, note these trends. Rigid job requirements or low salary grades may turn away the very hybrid talent you need. Consider highlighting mission impact, learning opportunities, and any workplace flexibility you *can* offer (e.g. telework options, ongoing training) to make roles more enticing. Many skilled candidates are motivated by impact and growth, not just pay.

## Where to Look: Sectors, Organizations, and Platforms

Hybrid professionals should cast a wide net when job hunting – great opportunities can pop up in academia, government, nonprofits, or industry. Below, we outline key sectors and specific organizations/platforms that often seek (or attract) hybrid public health/informatics talent.

### Global Health Agencies and NGOs

**International organizations** are a fertile ground for hybrid roles. Agencies like the **World Health Organization (WHO)**, **PATH**, **GAVI**, **UNICEF**, and **USAID**\-funded NGOs run global programs that need data systems, monitoring & evaluation, and health IT support. These organizations often list jobs on their own websites and on international development job boards (e.g. Devex, ImpactPool). Roles can range from *Health Information Systems Officer* on a malaria project, to *Data Analyst* for vaccine delivery programs. Global work may require willingness to relocate or travel, but early-career professionals especially can gain incredible experience through these postings.

**Tip:** Don’t forget multilateral development banks (World Bank, Asian Development Bank) and UN agencies – they hire health informatics specialists as consultants and staff. Also, global NGOs value language skills and cultural competency; highlight any international experience or multilingual abilities in your applications.

### U.S. Public Health Nonprofits and Contractors

Several U.S.-based nonprofits and consulting groups specialize in public health projects and often serve as contractors to CDC, NIH, or health departments. Examples include:

* **John Snow Inc. (JSI)** – Implements public health programs globally and across the U.S., often hiring analysts, M\&E specialists, and informatics advisors.

* **RTI International** – A research institute that contracts on projects from data modernization to program evaluation, seeking public health data analysts and IT professionals.

* **ICF**, **Mathematica** – Firms known for public health consulting and research; they recruit data scientists, epidemiologists, and IT project managers for CDC and state contracts.

* **Public Health Informatics Institute (PHII)** – A program of the Task Force for Global Health, PHII works on informatics capacity-building with health departments. They hire informatics project managers, trainers, and business analysts in public health IT.

* **Vital Strategies, FHI 360, Abt Associates** – Other organizations blending public health content with technical implementation, often posting roles in data management, surveillance, and digital health.

These organizations typically advertise on their websites under “Careers” and on public health job boards. They may also attend public health conferences (like APHA or HIMSS) – a great chance to network and learn about openings.

### Consulting Firms with Public Sector Portfolios

Large consulting companies have dedicated public sector and global health practices. **Deloitte**, **Accenture**, **PwC**, **Booz Allen Hamilton**, and **McKinsey** all have divisions focusing on government health systems, healthcare analytics, or international development. These firms hire roles like *Healthcare IT Consultant*, *Public Sector Data Analyst*, or *Global Health Informatics Specialist* to support contracts with agencies (for example, Deloitte might support a state’s immunization registry overhaul, or Booz Allen might have a CDC data analytics support contract).

Smaller specialized firms also exist – for instance, **Chemonics** or **Palladium** (USAID project implementers) and niche consultancies focusing on health informatics. **Development banks and contractors** often seek consultants for short-term assignments (e.g. assessing a country’s disease surveillance system).

**Tip:** To find these, check the careers sections of big consulting firms (filter by “Public Health” or “Global Health” in job search), and look at sites like Devex for consulting contracts. LinkedIn can also reveal which consulting firms have public health projects – search for connections or alumni working at these firms and see if they have relevant groups or postings.

### Government Health Department Job Boards

If you’re interested in working directly for health departments (local, state, or federal), make sure you’re checking the right job boards:

* **State and Local Government Portals:** Many city/county and state health departments post jobs on centralized government websites (e.g. GovernmentJobs.com or state civil service sites). For example, a county health department may list a *Disease Surveillance Data Manager* position on GovernmentJobs.com or on the county’s HR page. It takes digging – sometimes these portals aren’t well advertised – but they’re a goldmine for public health IT roles. Be prepared to navigate bureaucratic titles; “Epidemiologist I” might actually be a data analyst job in disguise.

* **USAJobs (Federal):** Federal agencies like CDC, NIH, FDA, and HHS post positions on **USAJobs.gov**. Search by keywords like “informatics”, “data science”, “public health analyst”. CDC in particular hires Public Health Informaticians and Data Scientists for its centers. Pro tip: set up saved searches on USAJobs with relevant keywords and filters (location, GS level) so you get email alerts when new jobs appear.

* **Professional Association Job Boards:** The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (**ASTHO**) and the National Association of County and City Health Officials (**NACCHO**) maintain job boards aggregating governmental public health vacancies. ASTHO’s Governmental Public Health Careers site offers a comprehensive job bank for state/territorial health agencies[\[2\]](https://www.apha.org/professional-development/public-health-careermart/public-health-jobs#:~:text=1,job%20postings%20from%20local%20health). NACCHO’s Career Center features job postings from local health departments nationwide[\[3\]](https://www.apha.org/professional-development/public-health-careermart/public-health-jobs#:~:text=3,A%20program%20in%20partnership%20with). These boards let you filter by location and role; they often include informatics, data analyst, and IT project manager positions at health departments.

* **Public Health CareerMart and Others:** APHA’s CareerMart and the PublicHealthJobs.org board list a mix of academic, nonprofit, and government jobs. They can be worth scanning for hybrid roles (use keywords like “informatics”, “data”, “IT”). Also check the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) job board for data-heavy epidemiology roles, and the Public Health Accreditation Board (PHAB) opportunities page for jobs related to quality and performance improvement (some may involve data systems).

**Tip for Employers:** To be discoverable by these job seekers, post your openings in multiple channels. Use the ASTHO and NACCHO boards (they allow health agencies to post vacancies to reach a targeted audience). Ensure your job title and description include relevant keywords (e.g. “informatics”, “data”, “digital health”) so that searches and filters will catch your post. Many hybrid professionals actively monitor these boards and will find your listing if it’s in the mix.

### Fellowship and Training Programs

Don’t overlook **fellowships**, **internships**, and **exchange programs** – they are often pipelines into hybrid careers, especially for early professionals. Some key programs:

* **CDC Public Health Informatics Fellowship Program (PHIFP):** A prestigious 2-year **paid** fellowship at CDC that trains professionals in applying IT and data science to public health. PHIFP fellows work on real-world projects at CDC or health departments, developing competencies in both domains. (For instance, one could be placed on a team modernizing a surveillance system.) *“The Public Health Informatics Fellowship Program (PHIFP) is a 2-year paid fellowship to apply information science and technology to the practice of public health.”*[\[4\]](https://www.cdc.gov/phifp/site.html#:~:text=The%20Public%20Health%20Informatics%20Fellowship,the%20practice%20of%20public%20health) Many alumni go on to lead informatics programs at state and local health departments.

* **CDC Public Health Associate Program (PHAP):** A competitive **two-year training program** for recent graduates to work in public health agencies nationwide. PHAP isn’t informatics-specific, but it gives early-career folks broad experience in community health programs – an ideal launching pad for future hybrid roles. *“The Public Health Associate Program is a competitive, two-year, paid training program with CDC”*[\[5\]](https://www.cdc.gov/phap/site.html#:~:text=Public%20Health%20Associate%20Program%20for,PHAP), placing associates in local or state health agencies to learn on the job. PHAP alumni often move into public health analyst or coordinator roles, which can evolve to include data projects.

* **ASPPH Fellowships:** The Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health (ASPPH), in partnership with CDC and other agencies, offers fellowships and internships for MPH graduates. One example is the **ASPPH/CDC Public Health Fellowship**, which provides mentored experience in public health practice, informatics, policy, and more. These fellowships build skills and often lead directly to job offers at the host agency or related organizations. (More than 60% of ASPPH/CDC fellows take governmental public health jobs after their assignments[\[6\]](https://aspph.org/our-work/practice/center-for-public-health-workforce-development/applied-learning-and-training/#:~:text=Since%201982%2C%20ASPPH%20has%20advanced,public%20health%20following%20their%20assignment).)

* **Global Health Corps (GHC):** GHC is a leadership fellowship for young professionals passionate about health equity. It’s a **paid, year-long fellowship** that places fellows in health organizations (NGOs or government) in the U.S. or Africa. Fellows work in pairs (one local, one international) on projects ranging from data analysis to program management. *Global Health Corps provides a paid fellowship for young professionals from diverse backgrounds to fight for global health equity*[\[7\]](https://barnard.edu/competitive-fellowships/global-health-corps-fellowship#:~:text=Competitive%20Fellowships) – a fantastic opportunity to gain field experience and join a network of health leaders. Alumni have gone on to roles at WHO, ministries of health, and innovative health startups.

* **Other Fellowships/Programs:** Consider programs like **Health for America Fellowships**, **Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) Fellowships** (often data-focused), **Global Health Fellowships** from organizations like CDC Foundation, or university-based fellowships in informatics and implementation science. Even the Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) at CDC – while focused on epidemiology – increasingly involves data and could be a stepping stone if you have an epidemiology bent.

**Tip:** Fellowship applications can be as demanding as job applications (essays, interviews). Treat them with the same preparation. They often have annual deadlines (e.g. PHIFP and PHAP recruit annually). If you’re early in your career (or transitioning), these programs can offer a structured path into the field, so it’s worth planning ahead and applying.

## Smart Strategies for the Job Search

Knowing where to look is half the battle. The other half is **how** you search and present yourself. As a hybrid professional, you might not fit neatly into HR’s boxes, so you need to be proactive and strategic. Here we discuss leveraging LinkedIn, finding consulting gigs, using advanced search techniques, and showcasing your hybrid expertise in applications.

### Leveraging LinkedIn as a Hybrid Professional

LinkedIn is more than an online resume – it’s a networking and research tool rolled into one. Here’s how to make the most of it:

* **Build a Hybrid Profile:** Craft your profile to highlight your intersectional skill set. Make sure your headline and summary reflect both public health impact *and* technical skills (e.g. “Public Health Data Scientist bridging epidemiology and IT”). Mention key keywords like “health informatics, data analysis, program evaluation, project management” – recruiters often search for these. A strong LinkedIn profile can open doors by itself; it’s your professional storefront.

* **Show Your Impact:** Use the experience section to give concrete, outcome-focused bullet points. For example, “Implemented a data dashboard for City Health Dept, reducing report turnaround time by 30%” or “Led requirements gathering for a new immunization system across 15 clinics.” This signals you can speak both the language of data and public health outcomes – exactly what employers want in a hybrid pro.

* **Engage and Network:** Follow organizations and companies of interest (the ones we listed earlier, for instance). Join LinkedIn groups related to public health informatics, global health, or data for good. Participate in discussions or at least observe what people are talking about – sometimes jobs are posted informally in these groups. Commenting thoughtfully on posts or sharing relevant articles can increase your visibility. Also, don’t shy from reaching out to contacts (or alumni from your school) for informational chats; many jobs come through referrals.

* **Job Hunting via LinkedIn:** Use the Jobs section to set up alerts for titles like “informatics”, “public health data”, “health analyst”, etc. You can also filter by remote vs. location as needed. LinkedIn’s job postings often include openings from NGOs, hospitals, and companies that may not be on other boards. And the “Easy Apply” feature can save time – but always customize your application if possible. Lastly, let recruiters know you’re open to work (you can turn on the \#OpenToWork setting privately to recruiters) and ensure your contact info is up to date.

**Tip:** Many hybrid professionals report that LinkedIn was instrumental in their career moves – either by learning about opportunities or being directly contacted by recruiters. Keep your profile current and professional. Consider posting occasionally about your projects or insights (e.g. a short post on a public health data challenge you overcame); this demonstrates your expertise and passion, and might catch the eye of a hiring manager in your network.

### Finding Consulting Gigs and Short-Term Projects

Not all opportunities are full-time jobs – many hybrid experts build their careers through **consulting contracts, part-time projects, and freelancing**. This path can offer flexibility, diverse experience, and sometimes higher pay, though it comes with the hustle of finding clients. Here are ways to locate consulting or short-term opportunities:

* **Consultant Marketplaces:** Platforms like **Devex**, **ImpactPool**, and **DevelopmentAid** list consulting opportunities with international NGOs, donor organizations, and governments. These often include RFPs (requests for proposals) or contract postings for specific projects. For example, you might find a 6-month consulting gig to develop a data management strategy for a country’s TB program. According to one seasoned consultant, keeping an eye on such procurement portals is key – *“Devex and ImpactPool are good online platforms for this”*[\[8\]](https://phspot.org/public-health-consulting-insights-from-a-candid-qa/#:~:text=,or%20firms%20on%20larger%20projects)[\[9\]](https://phspot.org/public-health-consulting-insights-from-a-candid-qa/#:~:text=,field%20of%20interest%20and%20expertise). You can create profiles on these sites and get email alerts for new postings in your domain.

* **Freelance Job Sites:** General freelancing platforms (Upwork, Freelancer.com, Toptal) sometimes have projects in data analysis or health research. While you might compete with a global pool (and pay rates vary), these can be good for building experience or side income. Look for projects tagged with things like “data cleaning for health survey” or “build dashboard for clinic”. If you’re new to consulting, starting with small freelance gigs can help you learn how to scope work and manage clients.

* **Professional Networks and Registries:** Some public health organizations maintain rosters of available consultants. For instance, WHO and UNICEF have consultancies (listed on their career portals) for which you can apply. The World Bank and other multilaterals have consultant rosters. Additionally, consider joining networks like **TechChange**, **Global Digital Health Network**, or **local public health innovation hubs** where short-term needs might be shared. Word of mouth is powerful: let your contacts know you’re open for consulting. Networking (both online and at conferences) can lead to your first consulting assignment when someone needs extra help on a project.

* **Direct Outreach:** If you have a target organization or health department in mind, don’t hesitate to pitch yourself for project work. For example, if a state health department got a grant for data modernization (and you know they might need help), you could reach out to a director or manager there, mention your skills and offer to assist as a contractor. It’s a bit bold, but health agencies sometimes struggle to hire quickly and may welcome an extra hand via contract. Just be sure you have any necessary business registration if they show interest (see the entrepreneurship section below).

**Tip for New Consultants:** Be clear about your niche and value. Do you bring expertise in a specific system (e.g. DHIS2, REDCap, SQL databases) or method (requirements gathering, program evaluation)? Highlight that. Also, start small if needed – freelance for established firms or on sub-projects to build credibility[\[10\]](https://phspot.org/public-health-consulting-insights-from-a-candid-qa/#:~:text=,With). Consulting involves a lot of **business development** (finding the work) in addition to doing the work, so factor that into your schedule and rates.

### Using Advanced Search (Boolean Magic) to Uncover Hidden Gems

Sometimes the perfect job or RFP is out there, but not easily found through typical browsing. This is where **advanced Google searches** (using Boolean operators and filters) come in. By crafting targeted search strings, you can surface listings and opportunities that others miss. In fact, recruiters themselves often use Boolean logic to find candidates, but many job seekers don’t use the same tactics to find jobs. According to LinkedIn, 70% of recruiters use Boolean strings to source candidates, yet only \~30% of job seekers know how to craft them – mastering these searches can uncover hidden listings and give you a first-mover advantage[\[11\]](https://www.resumly.ai/blog/use-boolean-search-techniques-to-uncover-hidden-job-opportunities-efficiently#:~:text=Even%20the%20most%20polished%20resume,appear%20in%20standard%20keyword%20searches).

Here are a few Boolean search tricks tailored to hybrid public health professionals:

* **Find Niche Job Posts via Google:** Use the site: operator to target specific websites or domains and keywords for roles. For example, to find informatics jobs in state governments, you might search:

* site:.gov "public health informatics" job

* This looks for pages on .gov sites that mention “public health informatics” and “job”. You might discover a job page buried on a state health department site that wouldn’t show up on general job boards. Similarly, site:who.int epidemiologist data might find WHO jobs blending data and epi skills.

* **Uncover RFPs and Contract Opportunities:** Public sector RFPs (Requests for Proposals) are often posted as PDFs or announcements on agency websites. To find these, combine terms like “RFP” or “Request for Proposals” with topic keywords. For example:

* "Request for Proposals" (informatics OR "data system") "health department"

* This could pull up PDFs or pages where a health department is soliciting bids for an informatics project. Adding filetype:pdf can be useful since many RFPs are PDFs:

* "Request for Proposals" public health data filetype:pdf

* If you’re interested in a specific funding area, include it: e.g., add “modernization” or “interoperability”. And to narrow by geography, include a state or city name in the search string.

* **Use OR and Quotes for Variations:** Our field has many titles for similar roles. When Googling, use the OR operator and quotes to cover synonyms. For instance:

* ("informatics specialist" OR "health data analyst" OR "data scientist") "health department"

* This will find pages containing at least one of those job titles plus the phrase “health department”. It casts a wider net for similar roles.

* **Customize to Your Niche:** Adapt these searches by including specific skills or interests. If you’re GIS-focused, add “GIS” or “geographic”; if you love immunization data, include “immunization registry job”. The goal is to mimic how an employer might phrase a posting. Also try intitle:job or intitle:position as part of your query, which targets pages with “Job” in the title (common on HR sites).

When you find something interesting via Google that isn’t on a major job board, you often gain an edge – fewer people are likely to have seen it. Just be sure to double-check the posting date and follow application instructions (some might be outdated archives).

**Tip:** Boolean searching is a skill – don’t get discouraged if your first attempts have too many or too few results. Tweak the terms, use quotes to tighten exact phrases, or add/remove filters. Also remember that some jobs might be posted in PDF bulletins or newsletters (especially government ones), which Google can index. Finding those hidden gems can feel like detective work, but it’s worth the effort when you land an interview for a role you *never* saw on LinkedIn or Indeed.

## Showcasing Your Hybrid Skills in Resumes and Proposals

Once you’ve found opportunities, the next challenge is convincing others you’re the right fit. Hybrid professionals often have diverse experiences that can either confuse or impress – the key is **framing your story** in a way that resonates with the role at hand.

* **Tailor Your Resume (or CV):** Customize your resume for each application, emphasizing the aspects of your background that align with the job description. If applying to a public health department, underscore your public health impact and your ability to navigate government contexts (e.g. mention if you’ve worked with CDC reporting systems or local clinics). If applying to a tech company or contractor, highlight technical deliverables (e.g. “built a database”, “managed an Agile software project for a health program”). A strong resume for a hybrid role will weave both sets of skills together – for example, “Bridged communication between epidemiologists and software developers to deliver a COVID-19 data dashboard used by 50+ jurisdictions.”

* **Use Clear, Jargon-Free Language:** Avoid acronyms or terms that one side of the house might not understand. A hiring manager with an IT background might not know “PDSA cycle”; a public health director might not know “CI/CD pipeline”. Translate your achievements into universally understood terms. Instead of “oversaw SDLC for immunization IIS”, say “led the software development life cycle for a statewide immunization information system (the registry that tracks vaccinations)”. You want the reader to grasp your value without needing Google Translate for jargon.

* **Highlight Cross-Disciplinary Achievements:** Any example where you served as a “bridge” or translator is gold. Did you train epidemiologists on a new data tool? Did you write requirements for a software project based on public health needs? Did you analyze health data and present it to a non-technical community group? These stories show you can navigate both worlds. Even better if you can quantify outcomes: e.g. “By translating public health requirements to the IT vendor, reduced development rework and saved an estimated 20% in project time.”

* **Positioning in Cover Letters or Proposals:** If a job application allows a cover letter, use it to explicitly connect the dots of your hybrid background. State your “hybrid pitch” – e.g. “I combine an MPH with software project management experience, uniquely positioning me to lead teams that improve health systems through technology.” For consulting proposals (when responding to an RFP or pitching a project), tailor your approach to show you get the health *and* tech context. For example, in a proposal to build a data warehouse for a health department, you might write: *“Our team brings experience in modern cloud databases* *and* *an understanding of public health data standards (like HL7 and surveillance case definitions). We will ensure the system not only meets technical requirements but also aligns with your epidemiologists’ workflows and CDC reporting mandates.”* This assures the client you won’t deliver a tech solution that ignores public health realities.

* **Show Impact and Adaptability:** Employers want to see that your mix of skills produces results. If you can, include a brief section in your resume like “Selected Achievements” or sprinkle in accomplishments that demonstrate impact (e.g. “Improved data timeliness by 40%, leading to faster outbreak responses” or “Secured $500K in grant funding by designing an innovative data tool for community health workers”). Also, emphasize adaptability – hybrid roles evolve, so noting something like “quickly learned new disease surveillance software to support pandemic response” signals that you can handle learning curves.

**Tip:** If you’re struggling with how to present your multifaceted experience, consider using a **combination resume** format that blends a skills summary with chronological experience. You might have a section titled “Skills & Expertise” up front where you list key hybrid competencies (e.g. *Public Health: program evaluation, community health* – *Data/Tech: SQL, Python, GIS, Agile project management*). This gives the reviewer an immediate snapshot of your dual expertise. Just be sure to back up each skill with evidence in your experience section.

Finally, don’t underestimate the value of **professional branding**. In a field as new as “public health informatics”, simply being able to articulate what you do and why it’s valuable already sets you apart. Whether it’s on LinkedIn, in an interview, or in a networking event, have your 30-second elevator pitch ready: *“I’m a public health professional and data scientist. I help health organizations modernize their data systems so they can make faster, smarter decisions – basically, I translate between the epidemiologists and the engineers.”* This kind of clear narrative can stick in people’s minds and often leads to referrals or job leads.

## Considering Entrepreneurship: Consulting or Starting Your Own Initiative

What if you can’t find the perfect role, or you have a great idea to improve public health through technology? For hybrid professionals, **entrepreneurship** is a viable and exciting track. This could mean freelancing/consulting as your own boss, or even starting a nonprofit or business to tackle a problem you’re passionate about. Here’s how to explore this path:

### Starting a Consulting Practice

Many hybrid professionals eventually go independent, offering their expertise as consultants. This can range from a solo freelance operation to forming a small consulting firm or LLC. Key considerations and resources:

* **Test the Waters First:** If you’re currently employed, you might begin by taking on a small side consulting project to see if you enjoy that mode of work[\[10\]](https://phspot.org/public-health-consulting-insights-from-a-candid-qa/#:~:text=,With). Consulting requires marketing yourself, scoping projects, and managing clients – it’s not for everyone, so it’s wise to get a taste before diving in full-time.

* **Business Basics:** To consult formally, you’ll likely need to register a business (at least a sole proprietorship or LLC) and handle things like contracts, invoicing, and taxes. Small Business Administration (SBA) resources and SCORE mentors can be helpful for learning these basics. Setting up a simple website or LinkedIn page for your consulting services will make you look more professional. Use a clear value proposition on your site like: “Helping public health organizations harness data and technology – services in data strategy, training, and system implementation.”

* **Finding Clients:** In the beginning, leverage your **network** heavily. Let former colleagues and partners know that you’re available for consulting. Often, nonprofits or health departments have short-term needs (e.g. facilitate a strategic plan, evaluate a data system, train staff on a new tool) that they might not advertise publicly but would gladly outsource if they know you. Also, as mentioned earlier, register on **consultant platforms** (Devex, etc.)[\[8\]](https://phspot.org/public-health-consulting-insights-from-a-candid-qa/#:~:text=,or%20firms%20on%20larger%20projects) and consider joining directories or consultant groups related to public health or data. One consultant recommends: *“Networking and targeted outreach are key – attend industry events, reach out to organizations in your field with a tailored pitch, and make sure you have a solid LinkedIn presence showcasing your past projects.”*[\[12\]](https://phspot.org/public-health-consulting-insights-from-a-candid-qa/#:~:text=,your%20visibility%20to%20potential%20clients)[\[13\]](https://phspot.org/public-health-consulting-insights-from-a-candid-qa/#:~:text=reach%20out%20directly%20with%20a,and%20Impactpool%20are%20good%20online).

* **Handling Uncertain Income:** Be prepared that consulting can mean feast or famine. Set your rates to account for not just labor but also your non-billable time (market research, proposal writing, administrative tasks). Early on, you might take some lower-paid gigs to build references, but know your minimum acceptable rate for sustainability[\[14\]](https://phspot.org/public-health-consulting-insights-from-a-candid-qa/#:~:text=Setting%20rates%20is%20a%20balance,Key%20considerations%20include). It’s okay to negotiate and even walk away from a client that can’t meet your floor. Many nonprofits have limited budgets – sometimes you can structure a smaller scope or a phased approach to fit their budget, but ensure you’re not consistently underpricing yourself to your detriment.

* **Resources for Public Health Consultants:** There are a few tailored resources worth checking out. PH SPOT (a public health career platform) occasionally runs workshops on building a consulting business. For example, they highlight the importance of not overpromising, and ensuring you have skills like proposal writing and project management nailed down[\[10\]](https://phspot.org/public-health-consulting-insights-from-a-candid-qa/#:~:text=,With)[\[15\]](https://phspot.org/public-health-consulting-insights-from-a-candid-qa/#:~:text=2,for%20a%20consultant%20to%20have). Another resource is Quisha Umemba’s “Public Health Consultant’s Starter Kit”[\[16\]](https://quishaumemba.com/f/starter-kit#:~:text=The%20Public%20Health%20Consultant%27s%20Starter,profitable%20public%20health%20consulting%20business), which provides guidance for aspiring public health consultants. Additionally, consider joining the **APHA Consultant’s Forum** (if you’re an APHA member) or similar communities to connect with peers and mentors.

### Starting a Nonprofit or Social Enterprise

If you have identified a gap in the field – say, a need for a new tool, service, or advocacy effort – you might consider forming a nonprofit or startup to address it. This is a big step, but for some hybrid professionals, being a founder can be incredibly rewarding and impactful.

* **Nonprofit Route:** Starting a nonprofit (NGO) involves creating a clear mission, forming a board, and registering for 501(c)(3) status (in the U.S.) or equivalent. It can be complex, but there are guides to help. For example, the National Network of Public Health Institutes (NNPHI) provides a guide on forming a public health institute[\[17\]](https://nnphi.org/explore-the-network/membership-pathways/guide-to-developing-public-health-institutes/#:~:text=Guide%20to%20Developing%20Public%20Health,forming%20a%20public%20health%20institute), and many state Attorney General offices or Secretary of State websites offer step-by-step instructions for nonprofit incorporation. Key steps include writing a mission statement, developing bylaws, filing incorporation papers, and applying for tax-exempt status. **Heluna Health** (formerly Public Health Foundation Enterprises) published a “5 Steps to Starting a Nonprofit” guide emphasizing defining your mission, researching community needs, and fulfilling legal requirements[\[18\]](https://helunahealth.org/news/5-steps-to-starting-a-nonprofit-organization/#:~:text=Forming%20a%20nonprofit%20organization%20can,liability%20among%20the%20group%E2%80%99s%20members)[\[19\]](https://helunahealth.org/news/5-steps-to-starting-a-nonprofit-organization/#:~:text=Before%20beginning%20the%20process%20of,term%20success). A big consideration is funding – you’ll need a strategy for grants or donations to sustain your NGO. One option is to seek a **fiscal sponsor**: organizations like Heluna Health or others may act as an umbrella for new projects, allowing you to receive grants without having your own 501(c)(3) yet[\[20\]](https://helunahealth.org/news/5-steps-to-starting-a-nonprofit-organization/#:~:text=There%20are%20a%20number%20of,manage%20administrative%20and%20operational%20functions). This can be a great incubator approach while you pilot your idea.

* **Social Enterprise or Startup:** Maybe your idea is a tech solution (e.g. a new app for contact tracing, an AI tool for outbreak detection) that could be a business. Starting a company means thinking about business models and possibly investors. Many cities have incubators or accelerators for health tech or social impact startups. Look for programs like **Health Tech incubators**, hackathons (to develop your idea and meet co-founders), or even pitch competitions through organizations like StartUp Health or MIT Solve. Even if you’re not aiming for venture capital, there are funding sources like **SBIR/STTR grants** (in the US) for small businesses doing R\&D in health, or innovation challenges by foundations.

* **Resources for Starting Up:** The **SBA** and **Score.org** have general startup checklists and free mentorship. If you’re going the nonprofit path, resources like The Foundation Center’s guides or **Human Rights Careers – How to Start an NGO**[\[21\]](https://www.humanrightscareers.com/issues/how-to-start-an-ngo/#:~:text=How%20to%20Start%20an%20NGO,5%3A%20Conduct%20local%20research%2C) offer useful tips (like clarifying your vision, building a team, and registering properly). And if you’re pursuing a tech solution, familiarize yourself with privacy laws (HIPAA, etc.) and open data resources in public health that could support your idea.

* **Balancing Passion and Practicality:** Entrepreneurship in our field often stems from passion to fix a problem, but be sure to validate the need. Talk to potential beneficiaries or customers – for example, if you want to build a new data tool for health departments, interview some public health officials to see if they’d actually use it (and possibly pay for it, if for-profit). If starting a nonprofit, see if you can partner with an existing organization initially; sometimes starting a new entity should be a last resort if no one else is tackling the issue.

**Encouragement:** Many hybrid professionals successfully carve their own path. Whether it’s a one-person consulting shop or a growing organization, your unique mix of skills means you can see solutions others might not. One public health consultant with 10+ years experience shared that building a consulting career required resilience through early challenges, but it allowed her to work on projects she truly cares about and fill gaps in the system[\[10\]](https://phspot.org/public-health-consulting-insights-from-a-candid-qa/#:~:text=,With)[\[22\]](https://phspot.org/public-health-consulting-insights-from-a-candid-qa/#:~:text=5,to%20grow%20your%20client%20base). If you crave autonomy or have an entrepreneurial itch, don’t be afraid to explore this route – just go in with eyes open, seek advice from those who’ve done it, and perhaps start small alongside a stable job until you’re ready.

### Platforms and Communities for New Entrepreneurs

To get started, here are a few platforms and resources:

* **Devex and ImpactPool** – Not just for finding jobs, but also useful to see what projects and RFPs are out there (helps you identify market needs)[\[8\]](https://phspot.org/public-health-consulting-insights-from-a-candid-qa/#:~:text=,or%20firms%20on%20larger%20projects).

* **PH SPOT “Career Club”** – A community where members (including consultants) share advice and opportunities; occasionally runs courses on consulting or freelancing in public health.

* **LinkedIn** – Use it to follow thought leaders in global health innovation or join groups like “Global Health Entrepreneurs” or “Public Health Innovators”. People often share funding opportunities or collaboration invitations there.

* **Mentorship Programs** – Consider finding a mentor who’s an independent consultant or NGO leader. For example, SCORE (in the US) can pair you with a business mentor. APHA or HIMSS also have mentorship for early-career professionals that could link you to someone in consulting or startups.

* **Fiscal Sponsors** – If you want to do charitable work without starting a nonprofit immediately, look into fiscal sponsorship. Organizations like Heluna Health, Tides Center, or local public health institutes sometimes act as sponsors for projects aligned with their mission. This way, you can focus on program work while the sponsor handles administrative burdens and grant management (for a fee).

In summary, **entrepreneurship is not an all-or-nothing proposition**. You can gradually build a side consulting gig, or launch a small project under another organization, and see where it leads. The skills you’ve developed – being able to work across disciplines, manage projects, innovate with limited resources – are exactly what’s needed to start something new.

## Conclusion: Bridging to Your Next Opportunity

Building a career as a hybrid professional in public health and technology means navigating a landscape that’s still catching up to the idea of cross-disciplinary roles. The good news is that awareness is growing – health agencies know they need you, and more employers are crafting positions for “bridge” skill sets. By looking in the right places (from rural health departments to global NGOs, from ASTHO’s job board to Google’s hidden corners of the web) and presenting yourself effectively, you can land roles where you make a genuine impact.

For job seekers, remember that your unusual background is a strength, not a weakness. You can translate between worlds – that’s a valuable asset, so market it as such. For organizations, to attract people like these, you may need to rethink how you advertise and design jobs: emphasize the mission, embrace flexibility where possible, and use language that speaks to both skill sets.

Whether you choose to work within a public institution, join a private firm, or blaze your own entrepreneurial trail, know that hybrid professionals are the future of solving public health problems in an increasingly data-driven world. As this toolkit has stressed, bridging gaps is what drives progress. Your career journey is another kind of bridge – connecting your passion for public health with the power of data and technology. By applying the strategies in this chapter, you’ll be well on your way to finding (or creating) the opportunity that’s the right fit, and in turn, contributing your unique talents to the health of communities.
