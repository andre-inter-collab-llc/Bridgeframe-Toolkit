# Bridging Business Analysis and Public Health Analysis

Business analysts and public health analysts both gather data and stakeholder input to solve problems, but they use different jargon and tools. In the private sector, a **Business Analyst (BA)** translates stakeholder needs into software requirements; in public health, an analyst defines community health needs and designs programs to address them[\[1\]](https://publichealth.tulane.edu/blog/public-health-analyst/#:~:text=In%20the%20field%20of%20public,devising%20ways%20to%20improve%20them)[\[2\]](https://s2-labs.com/blog/business-analysis-life-cycle/#:~:text=1). For example, a BA might study user workflows and write “requirements,” while a public health analyst performs community needs assessments and drafts intervention plans. Though the contexts differ, both roles share a stepwise approach: **understand the need, set objectives, gather requirements, design a solution, implement it, then evaluate results**[\[2\]](https://s2-labs.com/blog/business-analysis-life-cycle/#:~:text=1)[\[3\]](https://www.cdc.gov/public-health-gateway/php/public-health-strategy/public-health-strategies-for-community-health-assessment-models-frameworks-tools.html#:~:text=1,Evaluate%20process%20and%20outcomes). This article outlines the BA process steps, mapping key terms and tools to public health equivalents, so technical teams and health professionals can find common ground.

## 1\. Understand the Needs (Identify the Problem)

**Business Analysis:** A BA starts by collaborating with stakeholders to **understand the problem or opportunity**[\[2\]](https://s2-labs.com/blog/business-analysis-life-cycle/#:~:text=1). This involves asking the right questions, observing workflows, and listening to user frustrations. The BA “identifie\[s\] who is impacted” and gathers context around the issue[\[4\]](https://s2-labs.com/blog/business-analysis-life-cycle/#:~:text=,case%2C%20this%20included%20marketing%20teams)[\[2\]](https://s2-labs.com/blog/business-analysis-life-cycle/#:~:text=1). The goal is a clear problem statement or business case that frames why a project is needed.

**Public Health Analysis:** Similarly, a public health analyst identifies pressing health challenges and at-risk populations[\[1\]](https://publichealth.tulane.edu/blog/public-health-analyst/#:~:text=In%20the%20field%20of%20public,devising%20ways%20to%20improve%20them). They use epidemiologic data and community engagement to define the issue. For example, a PH analyst might investigate rising asthma rates in a neighborhood or gaps in vaccination coverage. This often involves **community health needs assessments** and stakeholder (community) interviews[\[3\]](https://www.cdc.gov/public-health-gateway/php/public-health-strategy/public-health-strategies-for-community-health-assessment-models-frameworks-tools.html#:~:text=1,Evaluate%20process%20and%20outcomes). The output is a community health report or needs statement.

**Common ground:** Both roles focus on *who* is affected and *why* the problem matters. BAs can learn from PH’s emphasis on social determinants and population impact, while PH pros can adopt BA tools like stakeholder matrices. For instance, a BA’s “stakeholders” (users, sponsors, IT) correspond to PH’s community partners (hospitals, schools, local government). Methods overlap too: BAs conduct interviews or surveys[\[5\]](https://s2-labs.com/blog/business-analysis-life-cycle/#:~:text=,methods%2C%20and%20improving%20failure%20messaging); PH analysts do similar qualitative interviews or focus groups. The key deliverable is similar: a clear definition of *what needs change* and *why*, whether it’s a business process or a health outcome.

## 2\. Define Scope and Objectives

**Business Analysis:** Next, BAs **scope the project**. They outline *what will be included or excluded* and define SMART objectives.[\[6\]](https://s2-labs.com/blog/business-analysis-life-cycle/#:~:text=Key%20Activities%3A) For example, in improving an e-commerce checkout, the scope might include credit card processing and shipping calculations, but exclude inventory or marketing features. This step often yields a **project charter or statement of work** listing goals, constraints, and success criteria[\[6\]](https://s2-labs.com/blog/business-analysis-life-cycle/#:~:text=Key%20Activities%3A).

**Public Health Analysis:** In public health projects, this maps to setting program goals and defining target outcomes. For instance, a vaccination campaign might scope its population (children under 5 in County X) and objectives (e.g. “increase immunization rate from 70% to 90% within 1 year”). PH professionals use **SMART objectives** (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound) to make goals concrete (e.g. “Reduce new HIV infections by 20% in 2 years”). They also identify constraints like budget, regulations, or cultural factors. This resembles a BA’s project charter but often appears as a **grant proposal, program plan, or health improvement plan**.

**Common ground:** Both sides agree on setting clear boundaries and goals before work begins. BAs might use terms like “deliverables” or “scope statement,” while PH folks speak of “outputs,” “interventions,” or “health outcomes.” Mapping terms:

* **Deliverable/Output:** A BA “feature” or report vs. a PH “program output” (e.g. number of clinics opened).

* **Success Metric:** BA “KPI” vs. PH “health indicator” (e.g. reduced disease incidence).

* **Project Plan:** BA uses Gantt charts or Kanban boards; PH uses **logic models** and program schedules[\[7\]](https://www.cdc.gov/cardiovascular-resources/php/toolkit/developing-and-using-a-logic-model.html#:~:text=Logic%20models%20are%20tools%20for,evaluating%20a%20program%20or%20intervention). For example, a logic model (a planning diagram) is a PH favorite: it *“communicates the purpose of the program and expected results”*[\[7\]](https://www.cdc.gov/cardiovascular-resources/php/toolkit/developing-and-using-a-logic-model.html#:~:text=Logic%20models%20are%20tools%20for,evaluating%20a%20program%20or%20intervention). BAs can think of a logic model as analogous to a product roadmap or requirement traceability matrix.

* **Scope boundaries:** BA says “in scope/out of scope”; PH might say “this intervention covers only primary schools, not adults.”

Both can document decisions in writing: BAs may write a scope statement; PH teams might draft a “community health improvement plan.” In either case, everyone signs off on goals before proceeding.

## 3\. Gather Requirements / Plan the Intervention

**Business Analysis:** A core BA task is **requirements gathering and analysis**[\[8\]](https://s2-labs.com/blog/business-analysis-life-cycle/#:~:text=3). This means eliciting details from stakeholders through interviews, workshops, surveys, and observing current systems[\[8\]](https://s2-labs.com/blog/business-analysis-life-cycle/#:~:text=3). BAs may write **use cases** or **user stories** (e.g. “As a user, I want X so that Y”) and build process models or data flow diagrams[\[8\]](https://s2-labs.com/blog/business-analysis-life-cycle/#:~:text=3). They translate real needs into functional requirements (what the system must do) and non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.), and may prototype wireframes or mock-ups to validate understanding[\[9\]](https://s2-labs.com/blog/business-analysis-life-cycle/#:~:text=Key%20Activities%3A).

**Public Health Analysis:** In public health, gathering requirements looks like **planning an intervention**. PH analysts would conduct community surveys, focus groups, or stakeholder interviews to understand needs. They might perform a **situation analysis** or **gap analysis** (e.g. availability of healthcare services, workforce capacity). Instead of “user stories,” PH teams might create **case scenarios** or **personas**: narratives describing a typical community member or patient. For instance, rather than saying “As a user,” they might describe “Mrs. Smith, a 70-year-old with diabetes, needs help managing her insulin supply.” These stories help ensure the solution fits real-life contexts. PH analysts also often build **logic models or flowcharts** to depict how interventions lead to outcomes[\[7\]](https://www.cdc.gov/cardiovascular-resources/php/toolkit/developing-and-using-a-logic-model.html#:~:text=Logic%20models%20are%20tools%20for,evaluating%20a%20program%20or%20intervention).

**Common ground (Term mapping):** Below are some equivalent concepts and tools to bridge the language gap:

* **User Story vs. Scenario/Persona:** Tech BAs use “user stories” to capture one feature from a user perspective[\[10\]](https://agilealliance.org/glossary/user-stories/#:~:text=To%20make%20these%20assumptions%20tangible%2C,%E2%80%9D). For public health, call them **community scenarios** or **case vignettes**. Example: A BA story “As a pharmacy manager, I want to track vaccine stock so no doses are wasted” could become a PH scenario: “In a rural clinic, the nurse needs a way to know when supplies run low during an immunization campaign.” Both achieve the same purpose (eliciting needs) but the latter uses a narrative style familiar to PH teams.

* **Stakeholder Analysis:** Both fields identify stakeholders, but PH often explicitly engages community representatives and coalitions. BAs can incorporate community members and advocate organizations into their stakeholder lists.

* **Business Process Model (BPMN) vs. Intervention Flowchart:** BAs draw process diagrams (often using BPMN) to show steps in a workflow. PH analysts use **logic models** or intervention flowcharts to map inputs→activities→outputs→outcomes[\[7\]](https://www.cdc.gov/cardiovascular-resources/php/toolkit/developing-and-using-a-logic-model.html#:~:text=Logic%20models%20are%20tools%20for,evaluating%20a%20program%20or%20intervention). For example, a BA’s flowchart of user login steps parallels a PH program logic model showing “inputs (funding, staff) → activities (education sessions) → outputs (number of clinics) → short-term outcomes (increased knowledge) → long-term impact (reduced disease)[\[7\]](https://www.cdc.gov/cardiovascular-resources/php/toolkit/developing-and-using-a-logic-model.html#:~:text=Logic%20models%20are%20tools%20for,evaluating%20a%20program%20or%20intervention).”

* **Backlog vs. Action Plan:** Tech teams maintain a backlog of features. PH teams keep action plans or **implementation plans**, often in text or spreadsheets. Both track tasks and priorities. A BA can simply call a backlog item an “action item” if working with public health stakeholders.

* **Acceptance Criteria vs. Evaluation Criteria:** In Agile, each user story has acceptance tests. In PH, each intervention has evaluation criteria (e.g. targets for coverage, behavior change). Defining success is critical in both; in PH it may involve specific health indicators or behavioral outcomes.

## 4\. Design and Validate Solutions

**Business Analysis:** With requirements in hand, BAs help design the solution. This could include technical designs or user experience prototypes. Key activities might include creating wireframes or mock-ups to visualize software changes[\[11\]](https://s2-labs.com/blog/business-analysis-life-cycle/#:~:text=Key%20Activities%3A), writing functional specifications, and conducting feasibility studies (cost/benefit, technical feasibility)[\[12\]](https://s2-labs.com/blog/business-analysis-life-cycle/#:~:text=,changes%20to%20the%20user%20journey). BAs also prepare acceptance test plans to validate that the solution meets the requirements.

**Public Health Analysis:** Analogously, PH analysts design the public health intervention or system. If it’s a new data system, they might sketch user interfaces or data collection forms. More often, they design program components: curricula, protocols, or outreach strategies. They may pilot test an intervention on a small scale (a *proof of concept*), soliciting feedback and adjusting. PH uses terms like “evidence-based design” and draws on theory (e.g. health behavior theories) to shape interventions. For evaluation, PH teams define **success indicators** (e.g. % of community reached, % with improved health markers) and plan how to measure them.

**Common ground:** Validation is iterative. BAs and PH pros both try out ideas before full rollout. A tech wireframe can be thought of like a PH pilot lesson plan or a draft public website. Both sides can use **wireframing tools** (e.g. Balsamiq, Axure) or even simple paper sketches to get stakeholder input early. Key mappings:

* **Prototype vs. Pilot:** A BA prototype (for a health app, say) corresponds to a PH pilot study or focus group on the proposed solution.

* **Feasibility Analysis:** BAs do cost/time/impact analysis; PH does feasibility (resources, cultural acceptance, policy alignment). Both result in adjusting the plan before launch.

* **Acceptance tests vs. Evaluation Plan:** BAs write acceptance test cases; PH teams write evaluation protocols (who collects data, how to analyze outcomes). Both ensure the final product solves the initial problem.

## 5\. Implementation and Project Management

**Business Analysis:** During implementation, a BA works closely with developers, testers, and stakeholders to ensure requirements are met. They may manage issue tracking, answer questions, and coordinate User Acceptance Testing (UAT). Agile BAs often facilitate Scrum ceremonies (planning, demos, retrospectives) and update the backlog as work progresses.

**Public Health Implementation:** Public health projects typically follow a project or program management approach. PH teams may use frameworks like **PNC meetings** or project charters. They rely on tools like workplans and Gantt charts. Communication is often via email, community meetings, or workshops. Instead of a “bug tracker,” PH might use a simple spreadsheet or meeting notes to track action items and issues.

**Common ground:** Coordination skills matter in both roles. Many project management principles apply (clear roles, risk management, change control), even if the terminology differs. Some software can be shared: For example, **Trello** or **Asana** (free tiers available) can visualize tasks for any team. Atlassian’s free plans let up to 10 users use Jira, Confluence, and Trello at no cost[\[13\]](https://www.atlassian.com/software/free#:~:text=Get%20started%20with%20Atlassian%20cloud,grow%20at%20your%20own%20pace). Open-source alternatives include **OpenProject** (full project management with Gantt/kanban, free community edition)[\[14\]](https://www.openproject.org/#:~:text=OpenProject%20is%20the%20leading%20free,We%20promise) and **Redmine** (flexible issue tracker with Gantt and calendar)[\[15\]](https://www.redmine.org/#:~:text=Redmine%20is%20a%20flexible%20project,database). Public health teams could use these tools instead of manual spreadsheets.

**Term mapping:**  
\- **Sprint/Iteration (Agile)** vs. **Milestone-based phases:** Many PH projects use fixed phases (planning, pilot, scale-up). BAs can align these with Agile sprints (e.g. “Sprint 1 covers needs assessment and planning”). \- **Issue Tracking:** In tech, defects go into JIRA or Redmine; PH teams might log concerns in an issue log or excel. Emphasize “bug” tracking as “issues needing resolution” in PH jargon. \- **Daily Standups vs. Team Huddles:** Some PH programs use daily briefs or weekly calls for the same purpose as Agile standups. \- **Stakeholder Reviews:** Both industries hold review meetings. In PH they’re often called “steering committee” or “monitoring meeting.”

## 6\. Evaluation and Continuous Improvement

**Business Analysis:** After implementation, BAs often conduct a **post-implementation review** to compare outcomes against targets[\[16\]](https://s2-labs.com/blog/business-analysis-life-cycle/#:~:text=Key%20Activities%3A). They track key performance indicators (KPIs) and document lessons learned. If a solution didn’t meet all requirements, the BA helps plan follow-up fixes or enhancements.

**Public Health Evaluation:** Public health closes the loop with program evaluation. This can be **process evaluation** (did we implement as planned?) and **outcome evaluation** (did health metrics improve?). PH analysts use formal frameworks (e.g. CDC’s evaluation framework) and tools like pre/post surveys, focus groups, or epidemiologic analysis. Findings feed back into program refinement or policy changes.

**Common ground:** Both fields aim for **continuous improvement**. Health uses cycles like Plan–Do–Study–Act (PDSA), similar to agile’s iterative releases. Mapping terms:

* **KPI (BA)** vs. **Health Indicators (PH):** BAs might report “increased user satisfaction by 15%”; PH reports “reduced infection rate by 10%.”

* **Quality Assurance (BA)** vs. **Quality Improvement (PH):** Different names, same idea of fixing problems quickly.

* **Lessons Learned:** Both teams capture what worked or didn’t. A BA’s retrospective is akin to a PH after-action review or conference presentation on best practices.

By actively sharing these translations (e.g., calling Agile *iterations* rather than sprints, or referring to evaluation metrics as *health outcomes*), both sides learn each other’s language. This shared understanding builds trust and smooths collaboration on public sector projects.

## Common Software Tools (and Open Alternatives)

BAs rely on many software tools – many of which PH teams can also use, especially since Office tools are ubiquitous in both sectors[\[17\]](https://brainstation.io/career-guides/what-tools-do-business-analysts-use#:~:text=Microsoft%20Office). Here are key categories and examples:

* **Office Productivity:** Excel, Word, PowerPoint – used everywhere for analysis, documentation, and presentations[\[17\]](https://brainstation.io/career-guides/what-tools-do-business-analysts-use#:~:text=Microsoft%20Office). (Open-source alternatives: LibreOffice, Google Sheets/Docs.)

* **Diagramming/Modeling:** Microsoft Visio or Lucidchart for process and data flow diagrams. Free option: diagrams.net (formerly draw.io) runs in-browser and exports BPMN or flowcharts. (BrainStation notes Visio is very popular among BAs[\[17\]](https://brainstation.io/career-guides/what-tools-do-business-analysts-use#:~:text=Microsoft%20Office); diagrams.net offers equivalent features for free.)

* **Project Management / Task Tracking:** Atlassian *Jira* (free for small teams up to 10 users[\[13\]](https://www.atlassian.com/software/free#:~:text=Get%20started%20with%20Atlassian%20cloud,grow%20at%20your%20own%20pace)) or *Trello* (Kanban boards, free tier) help track tasks/bugs. Open-source alternatives include **OpenProject**[\[14\]](https://www.openproject.org/#:~:text=OpenProject%20is%20the%20leading%20free,We%20promise) and **Redmine**[\[15\]](https://www.redmine.org/#:~:text=Redmine%20is%20a%20flexible%20project,database) for self-hosted project tracking with Gantt charts and collaboration. Both PH and BA teams can use these to organize tasks.

* **Requirements Management:** Simple cases use Excel or Confluence (free for 10 users) to list requirements. More advanced teams use tools like Jama or RequisitePro, but those are commercial. Open-source options include **Requirement Yogi** or even using GitHub/GitLab issue trackers.

* **Data Analysis:** BAs often use Excel or Tableau; PH analysts use R, Python, SAS, or Epi Info for statistics. Importantly, R (and RStudio) is **free and open-source**, and widely used in public health[\[18\]](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-statistics-data-analysis-public-health#:~:text=You%27ll%20then%20have%20a%20solid,quizzes%20with%20feedback%20along). As the Imperial College course notes, R is “completely free software…used by…practitioners everywhere”[\[18\]](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-statistics-data-analysis-public-health#:~:text=You%27ll%20then%20have%20a%20solid,quizzes%20with%20feedback%20along). Other PH tools: **Epi Info** (public-domain CDC software for epidemiology[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-source_health_software#:~:text=,is%20a%20tool%2C%20originally%20developed)) and **OpenEpi** (free web-based epidemiologic calculators)[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenEpi#:~:text=OpenEpi%20is%20a%20free%2C%20web,OpenEpi%20has). These can complement a BA’s data work in Excel or SQL when applied to health data.

* **GIS and Visualization:** Health projects often map data; free **QGIS** rivals ArcGIS. Both sectors can use tools like Power BI or Google Data Studio (free) for dashboards.

* **Collaboration/Documentation:** Atlassian *Confluence* (free small plan) or wikis share documentation. Many BA teams use SharePoint or Teams; PH might use similar or simple shared folders. Open alternatives include **BookStack** or **MediaWiki** for documentation.

By highlighting these tools (especially free or low-cost ones), PH agencies can adopt modern BA practices without heavy licensing. For example, a county health department could use OpenProject for its strategic plan or R for analyzing survey results, just as a tech firm would.

## Learning Resources

**Business Analysis Training:** Aspiring BAs can take online courses. For example, Coursera offers a *Microsoft Business Analyst Professional Certificate* (6 courses) covering requirements gathering, process modeling, and Microsoft tools[\[21\]](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/microsoft-business-analyst#:~:text=Microsoft%20Business%20Analyst%20Professional%20Certificate). There are also IIBA certifications (ECBA for beginners) and LinkedIn Learning courses (e.g., *Business Analysis Foundations*). Many BAs learn on the job with resources like the *BABOK Guide* (Business Analysis Body of Knowledge).

**Public Health Training:** PH analysts have specialized courses. Coursera’s *Epidemiology in Public Health Practice Specialization* (Johns Hopkins University) teaches population health, surveillance, outbreak investigation, etc.[\[22\]](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/professional-epidemiology#:~:text=This%20specialization%20is%20intended%20for,and%20investigate%20outbreaks%20and%20epidemics). Imperial College’s *Foundations of Public Health Practice* covers public health principles, program planning, and health protection[\[23\]](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/foundations-public-health-practice#:~:text=What%20you%27ll%20learn). For data skills, Imperial also offers a *Statistical Analysis with R for Public Health* specialization – including the free course *Introduction to Statistics & Data Analysis in Public Health*[\[18\]](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-statistics-data-analysis-public-health#:~:text=You%27ll%20then%20have%20a%20solid,quizzes%20with%20feedback%20along) – which even teaches R, “completely free software” used by statisticians[\[18\]](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-statistics-data-analysis-public-health#:~:text=You%27ll%20then%20have%20a%20solid,quizzes%20with%20feedback%20along). Other resources include edX courses (e.g. Harvard’s *Principles of Biostatistics*) and open training from CDC or WHO (e.g. CDC’s Epi Info tutorials, WHO’s online public health courses).

**Bridging the Knowledge Gap:** We encourage cross-training. For example, a PH team member could take the Coursera BA certificate[\[21\]](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/microsoft-business-analyst#:~:text=Microsoft%20Business%20Analyst%20Professional%20Certificate) or a LinkedIn course on Agile fundamentals, while a BA could enroll in a basic epidemiology or program evaluation MOOC[\[22\]](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/professional-epidemiology#:~:text=This%20specialization%20is%20intended%20for,and%20investigate%20outbreaks%20and%20epidemics)[\[23\]](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/foundations-public-health-practice#:~:text=What%20you%27ll%20learn). There are also hybrid training programs (like university certificates in health informatics or health systems management) that combine tech and health content. Sharing these resources helps each side appreciate the other’s expertise.

## Working Together

Ultimately, public health projects in technology settings succeed when teams **speak the same language** and respect each other’s tools. A BA might refrain from jargon (e.g. introduce requirements as **“program specifications”**), and a PH analyst might rephrase stakeholders’ needs in terms software teams understand (e.g. describing a process rather than expecting an Agile “user story”). Mapping terms and methods, as above, creates common ground. When both sides bring their skills (data analysis, stakeholder engagement, process modeling, evaluation) to the table, they can jointly develop systems and interventions that truly improve community health.
