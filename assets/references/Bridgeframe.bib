	abstract = {Thoroughly reviewed and eagerly anticipated by the agile community, User Stories Applied offers a requirements process that saves time, eliminates rework, and leads directly to better software. The best way to build software that meets users' needs is to begin with "user stories": simple, clear, brief descriptions of functionality that will be valuable to real users. In User Stories Applied, Mike Cohn provides you with a front-to-back blueprint for writing these user stories and weaving them into your development lifecycle. You'll learn what makes a great user story, and what makes a bad one. You'll discover practical ways to gather user stories, even when you can't speak with your users. Then, once you've compiled your user stories, Cohn shows how to organize them, prioritize them, and use them for planning, management, and testing.  User role modeling: understanding what users have in common, and where they differ Gathering stories: user interviewing, questionnaires, observation, and workshops Working with managers, trainers, salespeople and other "proxies" Writing user stories for acceptance testing Using stories to prioritize, set schedules, and estimate release costs Includes end-of-chapter practice questions and exercises  User Stories Applied will be invaluable to every software developer, tester, analyst, and manager working with any agile method: XP, Scrum... or even your own home-grown approach.},

	abstract = {Background
The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) is a determinant framework that includes constructs from many implementation theories, models, and frameworks; it is used to predict or explain barriers and facilitators to implementation success. CFIR is among the most widely applied implementation science frameworks, and after 15 years of use in the field, the framework was updated based on user feedback obtained via literature review and survey., Dissemination of the updated CFIR and accompanying outcomes addendum resulted in hundreds of requests from users for further guidance in applying the framework. In addition, observations of potential and actual misuse of CFIR in grant reviews and published manuscripts were the catalyst for the development of this user guide., As a result, the objective of this article is to provide a user guide and essential tools and templates for using CFIR in implementation research.

Methods
This user guide was generated from the combined wisdom and experience of the CFIR Leadership Team, which includes the lead developers of the original and updated CFIR (LJD, CMR), and has collectively used CFIR in more than 50 projects. The five steps as well as the tools and templates were finalized via consensus discussions.

Results
The five steps below guide users through an entire research project using CFIR and include 1) Study Design; 2) Data Collection; 3) Data Analysis; 4) Data Interpretation; and 5) Knowledge Dissemination. In addition, the article provides a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) section based on user queries and six tools and templates: 1) CFIR Construct Example Questions; 2) CFIR Construct Coding Guidelines; 3) Inner Setting Memo Template; 4) CFIR Construct Rating Guidelines; 5) CFIR Construct x Inner Setting Matrix Template; and 6) CFIR Implementation Research Worksheet.

Conclusion
This user guide details how to use CFIR in implementation research, from the design of the study through dissemination of findings, answers frequently asked questions, and offers essential tools and templates. We hope this guidance will facilitate appropriate and consistent application of the framework as well as generate feedback and critique to advance the field.

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              Many implementation efforts fail, even with highly developed plans for execution, because contextual factors can be powerful forces working against implementation in the real world. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) is one of the most commonly used determinant frameworks to assess these contextual factors; however, it has been over 10 years since publication and there is a need for updates. The purpose of this project was to elicit feedback from experienced CFIR users to inform updates to the framework.
            
            
              Methods
              User feedback was obtained from two sources: (1) a literature review with a systematic search; and (2) a survey of authors who used the CFIR in a published study. Data were combined across both sources and reviewed to identify themes; a consensus approach was used to finalize all CFIR updates. The VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System IRB declared this study exempt from the requirements of 38 CFR 16 based on category 2.
            
            
              Results
              
                The systematic search yielded 376 articles that contained the CFIR in the title and/or abstract and 334 unique authors with contact information; 59 articles included feedback on the CFIR. Forty percent (
                n
                 = 134/334) of authors completed the survey. The CFIR received positive ratings on most framework sensibility items (e.g., applicability, usability), but respondents also provided recommendations for changes. Overall, updates to the CFIR include revisions to existing domains and constructs as well as the addition, removal, or relocation of constructs. These changes address important critiques of the CFIR, including better centering innovation recipients and adding determinants to equity in implementation.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              The updates in the CFIR reflect feedback from a growing community of CFIR users. Although there are many updates, constructs can be mapped back to the original CFIR to ensure longitudinal consistency. We  encourage users to continue critiquing the CFIR, facilitating the evolution of the framework as implementation science advances.},

              Background
              The challenges of implementing evidence-based innovations (EBIs) are widely recognized among practitioners and researchers. Context, broadly defined as everything outside the EBI, includes the dynamic and diverse array of forces working for or against implementation efforts. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) is one of the most widely used frameworks to guide assessment of contextual determinants of implementation. The original 2009 article invited critique in recognition for the need for the framework to evolve. As implementation science has matured, gaps in the CFIR have been identified and updates are needed. Our team is developing the CFIR 2.0 based on a literature review and follow-up survey with authors. We propose an Outcomes Addendum to the CFIR to address recommendations from these sources to include outcomes in the framework.
            
            
              Main text
              
                We conducted a literature review and surveyed corresponding authors of included articles to identify recommendations for the CFIR. There were recommendations to add both
                implementation
                and
                innovation
                outcomes from these sources. Based on these recommendations, we make conceptual distinctions between (1) anticipated implementation outcomes and actual implementation outcomes, (2) implementation outcomes and innovation outcomes, and (3) CFIR-based implementation determinants and innovation determinants.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              An Outcomes Addendum to the CFIR is proposed. Our goal is to offer clear conceptual distinctions between types of outcomes for use with the CFIR, and perhaps other determinant implementation frameworks as well. These distinctions can help bring clarity as researchers consider which outcomes are most appropriate to evaluate in their research. We hope that sharing this in advance will generate feedback and debate about the merits of our proposed addendum.},

            Theories occupy different positions in the scientific circle of enquiry as they vary in scope, abstraction, and complexity. Mid-range theories play a crucial bridging role between raw empirical observations and all-encompassing grand-theoretical schemes. A shift of perspective from ‘theories’ as products to ‘theorising’ as a process can enable empirical researchers to capitalise on the two-way relationships between empirical data and different levels of theory and contribute to the advancement of knowledge. This can be facilitated by embracing theoretically informative (in addition to merely theoretically informed) research, developing mechanism-based explanations, and broadening the repertoire of grand-theoretical orientations.},

              Background
              The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) is a determinants framework that may require adaptation or contextualization to fit the needs of implementation scientists in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The purpose of this review is to characterize how the CFIR has been applied in LMIC contexts, to evaluate the utility of specific constructs to global implementation science research, and to identify opportunities to refine the CFIR to optimize utility in LMIC settings.
            
            
              Methods
              A systematic literature review was performed to evaluate the use of the CFIR in LMICs. Citation searches were conducted in Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, CINAHL, SCOPUS, and Web of Science. Data abstraction included study location, study design, phase of implementation, manner of implementation (ex., data analysis), domains and constructs used, and justifications for use, among other variables. A standardized questionnaire was sent to the corresponding authors of included studies to determine which CFIR domains and constructs authors found to be compatible with use in LMICs and to solicit feedback regarding ways in which CFIR performance could be improved for use in LMICs.
            
            
              Results
              
                Our database search yielded 504 articles, of which 34 met final inclusion criteria. The studies took place across 21 countries and focused on 18 different health topics. The studies primarily used qualitative study designs (68\%). Over half (59\%) of the studies applied the CFIR at study endline, primarily to guide data analysis or to contextualize study findings. Nineteen (59\%) of the contacted authors participated in the survey. Authors unanimously identified
                culture
                and
                engaging
                as compatible with use in global implementation research. Only two constructs,
                patient needs and resources
                and
                individual stages of change
                were commonly identified as incompatible with use. Author feedback centered on team level influences on implementation, as well as systems characteristics, such as health system architecture. We propose a “Characteristics of Systems” domain and eleven novel constructs be added to the CFIR to increase its compatibility for use in LMICs.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              These additions provide global implementation science practitioners opportunities to account for systems-level determinants operating independently of the implementing organization. Newly proposed constructs require further reliability and validity assessments.

Multilevel interventions that incorporate policy, environmental, and individual components should be evaluated with measurements suited to their settings, goals, and purpose. In this commentary, the authors propose a model (termed the RE-AIM model) for evaluating public health interventions that assesses 5 dimensions: reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. These dimensions occur at multiple levels (e.g., individual, clinic or organization, community) and interact to determine the public health or population-based impact of a program or policy. The authors discuss issues in evaluating each of these dimensions and combining them to determine overall public health impact. Failure to adequately evaluate programs on all 5 dimensions can lead to a waste of resources, discontinuities between stages of research, and failure to improve public health to the limits of our capacity. The authors summarize strengths and limitations of the RE-AIM model and recommend areas for future research and application.},

We approach this question, the problem of sustainability, building on a perspective on action research identifying the pivotal impor- tance of networks. More precisely, local action research interventions need to be conceptualized and approached as but one element in a larger network of action in order to ensure sustainability. A vital aspect of our perspective is that local interventions depend heavily on the support of similar action research efforts in other locations. This is essential for the necessary processes of learning and experience sharing. We suggest that the scaling (i.e., spreading) of intervention is a prerequisite, not a luxury, for sustainable action research. Empirically, we base our analysis on an ongoing, large-scale action research project within the health care sector (called HISP) in a number of developing countries. HISP provides a fruitful occasion to investigate key criteria for our ap- proach to action research, namely sustainability, scalability, and capacity to be politically relevant to the participants. We contribute to three discourses: (1) models of action research, (2) lessons for health information systems in developing coun- tries, and (3) more generally, IS implementations that are dispersed, large-scale, and have scarce resources.},

Against this conceptual foil, we examine the development of DHIS2, a global health platform inspired by public goods, focusing on the paradoxes that arise in the scaling process. We find that the scaling dynamics played out differently at the macro and micro levels, giving rise to the following paradoxes: addition of new functionalities to cater to the universe of users across the world (macro level) works counter to the needs of users in particular locations (micro level); responsiveness to the requests of the donors with a global view (macro level) distorts the production process, as the voices of users, situated in remote locations in developing countries, are not adequately heard; the system needs to be simultaneously relevant across the global (macro level) and the local (micro level), when the former calls for decontextualization and the later (re)contextualization. We then discuss challenges these paradoxes create with regard to attaining non-rivalry and non-exclusion, the defining characteristics of a public good.},

Aggregate provides a "click-to-deploy" server that supports data storage and transfer in the "cloud" or on local servers. Voice renders application logic using phone prompts that users respond to with keypad presses. Finally, Build is a application designer that generates the logic used by the tools. Designed to be used together or independently, ODK core tools build on existing open standards and are supported by an open-source community that has contributed additional tools.

Epi Info is a series of Windows 95, 98, and NT programs for use by public health professionals in conducting outbreak investigations, managing databases for public health surveillance and other tasks, and general database and statistics applications. With Epi Info and a personal computer, physicians, epidemiologists, and other public health and medical workers can rapidly develop a questionnaire or form, customize the data entry process, and enter and analyze data. Epidemiologic statistics, graphs, and tables are produced with simple commands like READ, FREQ, LIST, TABLES, and BAR. A component called Epi Map displays geographic maps with data from Epi Info. Epi Info is in the public domain and can be downloaded from the Internet. CD-ROM copies and printed manuals may also be available from private vendors. A study in 1997 documented 145,000 copies of the DOS versions of Epi Info and Epi Map in 117 countries. The DOS manual and/or programs have been translated into 13 non-English languages. Epi Info 2000 is an entirely new series of programs for Microsoft Windows 95, 98, and NT, written in Visual Basic, Version 6. It uses the Microsoft Access file format as a gateway to industry database standards. Although Epi Info 2000 data is stored in Microsoft Access files for maximum compatibility with other systems, many other file types can be analyzed, imported, or exported. Epi Info 2000 includes a Geographic Information System (GIS), called Epi Map 2000, built around the MapObjects program from Environmental Sciences Research Incorporated, the producers of ArcView. Epi Map is compatible with GIS data from numerous Internet sites in the popular ESRI formats. Epi Info 2000 retains many features of the familiar Epi Info for DOS, while offering Windows strengths like point-and-click ease of use, graphics, fonts, and painless printing.
