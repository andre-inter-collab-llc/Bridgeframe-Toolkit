::: {.callout-note}
The scenarios in this article are illustrative and fictitious, designed to help professionals in the health IT space relate to common challenges. The concepts discussed draw from established frameworks like BABOK and CDC methodologies, and the goal is educational: to spark discussion and point readers toward relevant resources.

## The Meeting That Goes Nowhere

Picture a common scenario: A state health department receives funding to modernize their disease surveillance system. They contract with a software vendor. Both teams are competent and committed. Yet within months, the project stalls.

The vendor's business analyst asks for "user stories." The epidemiologist provides a detailed case definition document. The BA explains that a case definition is not a user story. 

The epidemiologist wonders why the BA keeps asking about "acceptance criteria" when the CDC already publishes validation rules.

**Sound familiar?**

This is not a failure of intelligence or good faith. It is a failure of translation.

## Two Disciplines, Two Languages, One Broken Bridge

This pattern appears across public health IT projects. The IT world speaks of **user stories, sprints, and requirements traceability.** Public health speaks of **logic models, PDSA cycles, and program evaluation.**

Both disciplines are trying to define problems, design solutions, and measure success. But their terminology creates friction rather than collaboration.

What does that friction cost?

- **Scope creep**: Vague requirements lead to endless revisions
- **Missed requirements**: Critical public health needs get lost in translation
- **Delayed timelines**: Clarification loops consume sprint capacity
- **Poor adoption**: Systems that meet technical specs but fail field workers
- **Wasted funding**: Grant dollars spent on rework rather than outcomes

And the stakes are higher than any commercial software project. A delayed surveillance system means delayed outbreak response. A poorly designed immunization registry means children missing vaccines.

## The Parallel Frameworks Worth Exploring

A key insight: Business analysis (as codified in BABOK) and public health analysis (guided by CDC frameworks) are not incompatible. They are parallel.

| What BAs Call It | What PH Calls It |
|:-----------------|:-----------------|
| Stakeholder Analysis | Community Partner Mapping |
| Current State Analysis | Epidemiological Baseline |
| Requirements Specification | Program Protocol |
| Sprint | PDSA Cycle |
| KPI | Health Indicator |
| User Story | Service-User Scenario |
| Non-Functional Requirements | Implementation Characteristics |

The concepts align. The terminology diverges.

## Beyond Functionality: Why Implementation Context Matters

Consider a common scenario: A project management tool like Azure DevOps gets introduced to a public health team. The software's terminology (sprints, agile, user stories, backlogs) doesn't map naturally to public health workflows.

The reverse also happens: When technology vendors dominate an engagement with their BA frameworks, the public health perspective can get lost. The resulting products may not fit how health departments actually operate.

This is why implementation science matters so much in this space. According to CFIR (Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research), success depends on factors far beyond functionality:

- **Will people actually use it?** [(70% of change initiatives fail to achieve objectives)](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/leadership/changing-change-management)
- **Does it fit the organizational culture?**
- **Is there leadership commitment?**
- **Can it adapt to local context?**

A requirements document that checks every technical box but ignores these questions risks becoming shelfware.

## Three Ideas Worth Considering

**1. Start with the client's framework.**

Public health organizations operate within established methodological traditions. They may follow CDC evaluation frameworks, use logic models for program planning, or apply CFIR for implementation readiness. These existing frameworks are assets to leverage, not obstacles to work around.

**2. Standard "User Story" format may not fit clinical contexts.**

The "As a [user], I want [feature], so that [benefit]" template doesn't always capture clinical workflows. Alternatives worth exploring:

- **Given-Person-Should (GPS) Format**: "Given a positive TB test result, the contact tracer should initiate household investigation within 48 hours to prevent secondary transmission."
- **Situational Protocol**: "When a laboratory reports a confirmed measles case, the system shall generate a contact list and notify the assigned epidemiologist within 4 hours."

**3. Data standards deserve early attention.**

HIPAA, HL7, FHIR, USCDI, ICD-10, SNOMED, LOINC: in public health IT, these are often primary business requirements, not optional technical details to defer to developers.

## Starting a Conversation

The IT world often optimizes for efficiency. Public health often optimizes for equity and outcomes. Both are rigorous disciplines with systematic frameworks. When teams collaborate effectively, systems can actually improve health outcomes.

When they don't? Projects struggle, and both sides feel frustrated.

**Bridgeframe** is a work-in-progress toolkit exploring this intersection, mapping concepts between IT business analysis and public health frameworks. It is not intended as an authoritative guide, but rather as a starting point for discussion.

The hope is that resources like this can help professionals from both domains find common ground, and point toward the established frameworks (BABOK, CDC evaluation methods, CFIR, and others) that offer deeper guidance.

Because bridging this gap matters. In public health, project outcomes translate to health outcomes.
