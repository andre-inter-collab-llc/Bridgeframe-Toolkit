# Welcome {.unnumbered}

**Bridgeframe** is a practical toolkit for professionals who work at the intersection of information technology and public health. Whether you are a business analyst stepping into your first health department project, or a public health professional learning to collaborate with software teams, this book provides the translation layer you need.

## The Challenge

Two disciplines. Two languages. One shared goal: building systems that improve health outcomes.

**Business analysts** speak of user stories, sprints, and requirements traceability. **Public health professionals** speak of logic models, PDSA cycles, and program evaluation. Both are trying to define problems, design solutions, and measure success, yet their terminology creates friction rather than collaboration.

## The Solution

Bridgeframe provides:

- **A terminology dictionary** mapping IT/Agile concepts to their public health equivalents
- **Phase-by-phase guidance** aligning the BABOK lifecycle with CDC frameworks
- **A running case study** (CancerSurv) demonstrating concepts in practice
- **Templates and tools** for hybrid teams

## Who This Book Is For

- **IT Business Analysts** entering the public health sector
- **Public Health Informaticians** collaborating with software vendors
- **Project Managers** overseeing health IT implementations
- **Data Scientists** working with epidemiological systems
- **Students** in health informatics or public health programs

## How to Use This Book

This book is organized into three parts:

1. **Foundations**: Core concepts, terminology mapping, and the CancerSurv case study
2. **The Analysis Process**: Phase-by-phase guidance from planning through evaluation
3. **Putting It Into Practice**: Tools comparison and implementation science frameworks

Each chapter includes CancerSurv examples in callout boxes, making abstract concepts concrete.

::: {.callout-tip title="Getting Started"}
If you are new to this intersection, start with [Chapter 1: Introduction](chapters/01-introduction.qmd) and the [Terminology Dictionary](chapters/03-terminology.qmd). If you are already working on a project, jump to the relevant phase chapter.
