# Design & Solution Definition / Intervention Design

With requirements defined, we move to designing the solution. In business analysis, this is **Solution Design** or **Design Definition**. In public health, it parallels **Intervention Design** and **Implementation Planning**. Both involve translating requirements into a blueprint for action.

## The Dual Framework

| BA Perspective | PH Perspective |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| Solution Architecture | Intervention Framework |
| System Design | Program Design |
| Interface Design | Service Delivery Model |
| Integration Design | Health Information Exchange |
| Change Management Plan | Implementation Strategy (CFIR) |

## Architecture and Framework

### Solution Architecture

BA solution architecture defines:

- System components and their relationships
- Technology stack selection
- Integration points with existing systems
- Data flow between components
- Security architecture

### Intervention Framework

PH intervention design defines:

- Core intervention components
- Delivery mechanisms
- Target populations
- Adaptable vs. core elements
- Contextual considerations

```

**Intervention Framework (PH):**

CancerSurv delivers the surveillance intervention through:

- **Core components**: Case abstraction, data quality, NPCR reporting (non-negotiable)
- **Adaptable elements**: Dashboard customization, local report templates
- **Delivery mechanism**: Cloud-based SaaS with local training support
- **Target population**: State cancer registries, hospital tumor registrars
:::

## Design Patterns

### User Interface Design

Both domains emphasize user-centered design:

**BA UI/UX Approach:**

- Wireframes and mockups
- User journey mapping
- Usability testing
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG)

**PH Service Design Approach:**

- Patient journey mapping
- Cultural competency review
- Health literacy assessment
- Equity impact analysis

### Key Design Principles

| Principle | BA Application | PH Application |
|:----------|:---------------|:---------------|
| **Simplicity** | Minimize clicks, clear navigation | Reduce complexity for adoption |
| **Consistency** | Standard UI patterns | Consistent with clinical workflows |
| **Feedback** | Visual confirmation of actions | Clear outcome indicators |
| **Error Prevention** | Validation before submission | Built-in clinical decision support |
| **Flexibility** | Customizable views, workflows | Adaptable to local context |

## Integration Design

### Connecting Systems

Health IT projects require extensive integration:

    end

    V -->|Batch| API
    API --> Core
    Core -->|XML| N
```

### Integration Standards

| Standard | Use Case | Design Consideration |
|:---------|:---------|:---------------------|
| **HL7 FHIR** | Real-time EHR integration | REST APIs, JSON payloads |
| **HL7 v2.x** | Legacy lab interfaces | Message parsing, acknowledgments |
| **NAACCR XML** | Cancer registry exchange | Schema validation, field mapping |
| **Direct Protocol** | Secure health messaging | Certificate management |

## Implementation Readiness Assessment

### CFIR for Design Validation

The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) provides a lens for evaluating design decisions:

| CFIR Domain | Design Questions |
|:------------|:-----------------|
| **Intervention Characteristics** | Is the design evidence-based? Is it adaptable? |
| **Outer Setting** | Does it meet regulatory requirements? Does it connect to external systems? |
| **Inner Setting** | Does it fit organizational workflows? Is infrastructure adequate? |
| **Individuals** | Will users accept it? What training is needed? |
| **Process** | How will it be implemented? Who champions it? |

::: {.callout-note title="CancerSurv Example"}
**CFIR-Informed Design Review:**

| CFIR Construct | CancerSurv Design Decision | Rationale |
|:---------------|:---------------------------|:----------|
| Relative Advantage | Modern UI, mobile access | Clear improvement over mainframe |
| Complexity | Phased rollout, role-based views | Reduce cognitive load |
| Adaptability | Configurable data fields | Support local registry needs |
| Available Resources | Cloud-hosted, vendor support | Minimize IT infrastructure burden |
| Self-Efficacy | Embedded training, help system | Build user confidence |
:::

## Prototyping and Validation

### Iterative Design

Design should be validated before full development:

**BA Prototyping:**

- Low-fidelity wireframes for concept validation
- High-fidelity mockups for detailed feedback
- Interactive prototypes for workflow testing
- MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for market validation

**PH Piloting:**

- Formative research with target population
- Pilot testing in representative sites
- Rapid cycle evaluation (PDSA)
- Fidelity assessment

### Prototype Fidelity Levels

| Level | BA Artifact | PH Artifact | Purpose |
|:------|:------------|:------------|:--------|
| **Low** | Paper sketches, Balsamiq | Concept paper, draft protocol | Concept validation |
| **Medium** | Clickable mockups | Pilot at 1-2 sites | Workflow validation |
| **High** | Working prototype | Multi-site pilot | Full process validation |

## Change Management Planning

### Preparing for Transition

Design must include plans for organizational change:

**BA Change Management:**

- Stakeholder impact analysis
- Communication plan
- Training plan
- Resistance management
- Transition strategy

**PH Implementation Planning:**

- Capacity building
- Technical assistance model
- Sustainability planning
- Scale-up strategy

::: {.callout-note title="CancerSurv Example"}
**Change Management Elements:**

| Element | Plan |
|:--------|:-----|
| **Training** | 3-tier approach: super-users (in-person), all users (webinar), ongoing (self-paced modules) |
| **Communication** | Monthly newsletters, demo sessions at registrar conferences |
| **Support** | Help desk during business hours; online knowledge base; user community forum |
| **Rollout** | Phase 1: High-volume hospitals; Phase 2: Remaining facilities; Phase 3: Full operation |
:::

## Design Documentation

### What to Document

Design documentation bridges requirements and implementation:

| Document | BA Content | PH Content |
|:---------|:-----------|:-----------|
| **Architecture Document** | System components, technology stack | Intervention components, delivery model |
| **Interface Specifications** | Screen layouts, navigation flows | Service user touchpoints |
| **Integration Specifications** | APIs, message formats | Data exchange protocols |
| **Data Design** | Database schema, data flows | Data collection instruments |
| **Security Design** | Access controls, encryption | Privacy protections, consent |
| **Transition Plan** | Deployment, training, support | Implementation, capacity building |

## Deliverables from This Phase

| BA Deliverable | PH Deliverable | Purpose |
|:---------------|:---------------|:--------|
| Solution Architecture | Intervention Framework | Define solution structure |
| UI/UX Design | Service Delivery Model | Specify user experience |
| Integration Design | HIE Specifications | Define system connections |
| Prototype | Pilot Protocol | Validate design |
| Change Management Plan | Implementation Strategy | Prepare organization |

## Moving Forward

With design complete, the next phase focuses on **Implementation**: building, deploying, and rolling out the solution while managing the organizational change required for adoption.
