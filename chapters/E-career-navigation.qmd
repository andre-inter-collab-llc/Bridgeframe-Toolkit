## Finding and Landing Roles at the BA/PH Intersection

The integration of business analysis and public health is not merely a theoretical exercise in framework alignment; it is a burgeoning labor market reality. However, a significant translation gap exists within the workforce ecosystem itself. While the operational need for professionals who can navigate both epidemiological principles and information technology (IT) requirements is acute, the job market often lacks the taxonomy to describe them.

Human Resources departments, government civil service commissions, and automated Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) predominantly operate within siloed definitions: a candidate is either a "Health Scientist" or an "IT Specialist," rarely both. This appendix addresses the "structural invisibility" of the hybrid professional, providing a comprehensive analysis of the employment landscape and practical strategies for navigating it.

::: {.callout-tip title="The Bridgeframe Workforce Philosophy"}
*Context* is the most valuable currency in health IT. Technical skills (SQL, Python, Jira) are commodities that can be learned or contracted out. Domain context, understanding *why* a disease case definition changes during an outbreak or *how* a rural clinic workflow differs from an urban hospital, is the scarce resource.

The career path for the Bridgeframe professional is rarely linear. It does not always move from "Junior Analyst" to "Senior Analyst." Instead, it often moves laterally across sectors, accumulating context in one domain to leverage it in another.
:::

## The Landscape of Opportunity

Research into the public health workforce reveals a distinct ecosystem of opportunity. The demand for hybrid skills is universal, but the *capacity* to hire and the *language* used to describe these roles varies significantly by sector. We can map these sectors onto a "Maturity Model" of hybrid employment.

### The Incubator: Local and Rural Health Departments

Early-career professionals should consider prioritizing local health organizations (LHOs) in communities with limited access to highly trained workers. These environments, including rural county health departments, tribal health organizations, and small community nonprofits, offer a unique value proposition: **necessity-driven hybridization**.

#### The Operational Reality

In a large, well-funded state health department, roles are siloed. A "Database Administrator" manages the servers; an "Epidemiologist" analyzes the data; a "Health Educator" creates the charts.

In a rural county health department serving 20,000 residents, a single employee often performs all three functions. They may troubleshoot the clinic's label printer in the morning (IT Support), query the state immunization registry at lunch (Data Analysis), and present vaccination rates to the County Board of Health in the evening (Data Visualization).

#### Strategic Advantages

| Advantage | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| **Full-stack experience** | Exposure to the entire data lifecycle, from point of collection to point of reporting. This end-to-end visibility provides deep understanding of data provenance and quality issues at the source. |
| **Rapid decision cycles** | Unlike federal agencies where changes take years, local departments often need immediate solutions. An analyst can propose, build, and implement a new tracking tool in a single week. |
| **High impact** | The hybrid professional in this setting is often the only person with advanced data skills, giving them disproportionate influence on agency operations and strategy. |

#### Navigating the Challenges

- **Title ambiguity**: These roles almost never carry titles like "Informatics Specialist" or "Business Analyst." Instead, search for titles such as *Health Educator*, *Emergency Preparedness Coordinator*, *Disease Intervention Specialist*, or *Program Coordinator*.
- **Resource constraints**: Salaries are typically lower than in the private sector. Consider this compensation gap as an investment in real-world experience.
- **Legacy infrastructure**: Be prepared to work with outdated hardware, slow internet connections, and paper-based processes. Learning to design systems within these constraints is a critical skill for any high-level architect.

### The Intermediary: State Health Departments and Large Universities

State-level agencies and large academic institutions act as the "middle layer" of the public health stack, translating federal funding and standards into local implementation.

#### State Health Departments

State health departments manage the centralized systems of record: the Electronic Disease Surveillance System (EDSS), the Immunization Information System (IIS), and Vital Records. Roles here focus heavily on *interoperability* and *compliance*. The analyst ensures that data flowing from hospitals (via HL7 messages) meets the validation rules required by the CDC.

**Typical titles**: *Epidemiologist (Informatics)*, *Surveillance System Manager*, *Data Modernization Lead*, *Interoperability Coordinator*.

#### Universities and Academic Centers

Universities are often the engines of research and workforce development. They hire staff to manage large research datasets, coordinate multi-site clinical trials, or evaluate public health programs. Positions often bridge the gap between Principal Investigators (academics) and Data Management Centers (IT).

**Typical titles**: *Research Data Manager*, *Center Administrator*, *Project Coordinator*.

### The Engine: Federal Contractors and Consultancies

A significant portion of the public health IT workforce is employed not by the government directly, but by the private ecosystem that supports it. Since government agencies often lack the flexibility to hire rapid-response IT teams, they contract this work out to consulting firms.

#### Large Systems Integrators

Firms like [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/careers/careers.html), [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/careers), [Booz Allen Hamilton](https://www.boozallen.com/careers.html), [Leidos](https://careers.leidos.com/), [GDIT (General Dynamics)](https://www.gdit.com/careers/), and [ICF](https://www.icf.com/careers) execute the massive modernization contracts (e.g., CDC's Data Modernization Initiative).

- **The culture**: These firms operate with corporate speed. They value "billable" skills: specific experience with platforms (Salesforce, ServiceNow, Azure) combined with the ability to obtain security clearances (Public Trust).
- **The hybrid value**: These firms need Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) who can sit in a room with CDC scientists, understand the nuance of "hepatitis serology," and translate it into user stories for software developers.

#### Niche Public Health Consultancies

Specialized boutique firms focus exclusively on the public health domain, often offering a culture more aligned with public health values.

**Key players**: [J Michael Consulting](https://jmichaelconsulting.com/careers/), [Berry Technology Solutions](https://berrytechnology.com/careers/), [Lantana Consulting Group](https://www.lantanagroup.com/careers/) (standards focus), [Public Health Informatics Institute (PHII)](https://phii.org/who-we-are/join-our-team/) (a nonprofit/consultancy hybrid).

These firms often handle the "high-touch" aspects of informatics: training, technical assistance to states, and standards development (HL7/FHIR implementation guides).

### The Infrastructure: EHR Vendors and Retail Health

Private sector entities that *generate* clinical data are increasingly hiring public health experts to ensure their products remain relevant and compliant.

#### Electronic Health Record Vendors

Companies like [Epic](https://careers.epic.com/), [Oracle Health (Cerner)](https://www.oracle.com/careers/), [MEDITECH](https://ehr.meditech.com/careers), and [athenahealth](https://www.athenahealth.com/careers) need professionals who understand the regulatory landscape. Federal regulations (like "Promoting Interoperability") mandate that EHRs must be able to send data to public health agencies.

**Typical titles**: *Implementation Consultant*, *Regulatory Affairs Analyst*, *Public Health Liaison*.

#### National Pharmacy Chains

Retail health giants like [CVS Health](https://jobs.cvshealth.com/), [Walgreens](https://jobs.walgreens.com/), and [Rite Aid](https://careers.riteaid.com/) have transformed into primary care and public health hubs. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, pharmacies generate massive volumes of immunization and testing data. These companies recruit informatics professionals to manage complex data flows between thousands of retail locations and fifty distinct state immunization registries.

**Focus areas**: Population health analytics, medication adherence tracking, interoperability management.

## The RFP Search Strategy

Standard job searching is *reactive*: a candidate waits for a job description to be posted and then applies. The Bridgeframe strategy is *proactive*: it analyzes the **business drivers** of hiring to identify opportunities before they are advertised.

In the public sector, jobs are downstream of **projects**, and projects are downstream of **funding**. Before a job description can be posted, an agency must secure a budget and usually hire a vendor to execute the work. This procurement process leaves a public paper trail that savvy job seekers can follow.

The central document in this trail is the **Request for Proposal (RFP)**.

### The Logic of Procurement-Based Job Searching

When a government agency needs to modernize a system (like the CancerSurv registry), they rarely build it in-house. Instead, they release an RFP to hire a private vendor. This document contains three critical pieces of intelligence:

| Component | What It Tells You |
|:----------|:------------------|
| **Problem Statement** | Describes exactly what is broken (e.g., "Legacy mainframe cannot accept HL7 2.5.1 messages") |
| **Solution Requirements** | Describes exactly what skills are needed (e.g., "Vendor must provide data migration, cloud architecture, and training for 500 registrars") |
| **Timeline** | Describes when the work (and the hiring) will begin |

**The strategy**:

- **Finding the RFP = Finding the Demand**: If you find an RFP for "Surveillance System Modernization," you know that specific high-value skills (Cloud, SQL, Training) are about to be in demand in that geographic area.
- **Finding the Award Notice = Finding the Employer**: Eventually, the agency announces which vendor won the contract. That vendor has just received a multi-million dollar contract and is legally obligated to staff the project immediately.

### Google Boolean Search Operators

Most RFPs are buried on obscure government procurement portals. However, they are almost always indexed by Google. By using Boolean search operators, you can locate the source documents directly.

#### Limiting Results by Date

To find only recent postings, use Google's date filtering tools:

1. **Using Google Search Tools**: After running your search, click "Tools" below the search bar, then "Any time" → select "Past week," "Past month," or "Custom range."

2. **Using URL Parameters**: Append `&tbs=qdr:w` (past week), `&tbs=qdr:m` (past month), or `&tbs=qdr:y` (past year) to your Google search URL.

3. **Using the `after:` Operator**: Add `after:2026-01-01` to your search string to find only documents indexed after a specific date.

For job searches, limiting to the past week or month ensures you are seeing active opportunities rather than archived postings. For RFP searches, consider a broader timeframe (past 3 to 6 months) since procurement cycles move slowly.

#### The Master Search String

```
(RFP OR "Request for Proposal" OR "Request for Applications" OR 
"Notice of Funding Opportunity") AND ("Public Health" OR "Epidemiology" 
OR "Surveillance" OR "Informatics" OR "Vital Records") AND ("System" 
OR "Modernization" OR "Implementation" OR "Software" OR "Data") 
filetype:pdf site:.gov
```

**Deconstructing the operators**:

| Operator Group | Purpose |
|:---------------|:--------|
| **Document type** | `(RFP OR "Request for Proposal"...)` casts a wide net for solicitation names |
| **Domain** | `AND ("Public Health"...)` ensures content is relevant to the field |
| **Activity** | `AND ("System"...)` ensures the project has a technical/IT component |
| **filetype:pdf** | Official government RFPs are almost universally PDF documents |
| **site:.gov** | Restricts results to US government domains (federal, state, and local) |

### Customizing Your Search

#### Strategy A: Geographic Targeting

If you wish to work in a specific state or region, add location keywords:

```
...AND ("Texas" OR "TX" OR "Austin")...
```

#### Strategy B: The Winning Vendor Hunt

Finding an old RFP is valuable because it leads to the Award Notice. If an RFP was due 3 months ago, the contract has likely just been awarded.

```
("Notice of Award" OR "Contract Award" OR "Bid Tabulation" OR 
"Intent to Award") AND ("Department of Health" OR "CDC") AND 
("IT" OR "Informatics" OR "Data System") 2024..2026
```

The `2024..2026` operator (two dots) tells Google to search for numbers within that range, helping identify recent fiscal year awards.

#### Strategy C: Skill-Specific Targeting

If you have a niche skill (e.g., HL7 FHIR), search for RFPs that specifically require it:

```
(RFP OR "Scope of Work") AND "Public Health" AND ("FHIR" OR "HL7" 
OR "Interoperability") filetype:pdf
```

::: {.callout-note title="CancerSurv Example: The RFP Strategy in Action"}
**The Scenario**: The State Health Department releases an RFP for the "CancerSurv Modernization Project" (RFP #2026-CS-001). The RFP describes a need to "replace a legacy mainframe system with a cloud-based registry compliant with NAACCR standards."

**The Job Seeker**: Alex is a Business Analyst with SQL skills who wants to transition into public health. Alex runs the Google Boolean search:

`("Request for Proposal") AND "Cancer Registry" AND "Modernization" filetype:pdf site:.gov`

**The Insight**: Alex finds the RFP and reads the Scope of Work. Section 4.2 states: "Vendor must provide training and change management for 150 hospital registrars." Alex realizes this is a green flag, as Alex has extensive experience in corporate training.

**The Move**: Alex searches for the award notice: `("Contract Award" OR "Bid Tabulation") AND "CancerSurv"`. The search reveals that TechHealth Solutions won the bid last month.

Alex goes to TechHealth's careers page. There is no "Cancer Registry Trainer" job listed yet. Alex sends a proactive application to the TechHealth hiring manager: "I see TechHealth won the CancerSurv contract. The RFP requires extensive training for 150 registrars. My background in large-scale change management training would allow you to meet that deliverable immediately."

**The Result**: TechHealth was indeed worrying about how to staff the training component. Alex is interviewed immediately, bypassing the competitive stack of generic resumes.
:::

### The Blind Application

Once you identify a winning vendor, the next step is the proactive application. Even if the vendor has not yet posted job openings, they are likely in the "ramp-up" phase.

**Sample outreach script**:

> "I noticed that [Company Name] was recently awarded the Disease Surveillance Modernization contract. I have reviewed the RFP requirements and see a need for [specific skill]. I have [X] years of experience executing exactly this type of migration for public health agencies and would like to discuss how I can support the new contract."

This approach positions you not as a job seeker asking for a favor, but as a solution provider solving an immediate problem for the vendor.

### The Power of Collaboration

You do not have to navigate the job market, or the RFP process, alone. Collaboration multiplies your reach and fills gaps in your expertise.

#### For RFP Responses

If you identify an RFP opportunity but lack certain skills (whether technical, domain-specific, or the hybrid professional perspective itself), consider partnering with others. Organizations like [Intersect Collaborations LLC](https://www.intersectcollaborations.com/) specialize in bridging business analysis and public health. Teaming arrangements are common in government contracting; a small firm with deep domain expertise can partner with a larger firm that has the administrative capacity to manage federal contracts.

#### For Job Seekers

Even if you already have a position, you may benefit from coaching or mentorship to prepare for a hybrid role. Reaching out to consultancies or professionals in the Bridgeframe space can help you:

- Translate your existing experience into the language of the other domain
- Identify skill gaps and training resources
- Practice "bridge" interview techniques
- Connect with networks that understand hybrid roles

The hybrid professional community is still small enough that collaboration is often more valuable than competition. A referral from someone who understands your unique skill set can open doors that cold applications cannot.

## Specialized Job Boards and Platforms

While the RFP strategy unearths hidden opportunities, traditional platforms remain a necessary component of a comprehensive search. The hybrid professional must know *where* to look.

### Platform Directory

### Target Employer Watch List

A proactive search involves monitoring specific companies known to hire hybrid talent.

#### Federal Contractors

These firms are the primary engine of federal health IT employment:

- [Leidos](https://careers.leidos.com/), [GDIT](https://www.gdit.com/careers/), [Booz Allen Hamilton](https://www.boozallen.com/careers.html)
- [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/careers/careers.html), [Accenture Federal Services](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/careers)
- [ICF](https://www.icf.com/careers), [Maximus](https://www.maximus.com/careers)

**Strategy**: Monitor their "Health" or "Civilian" career pages. Look for keywords like "CDC," "CMS," or "Data Modernization."

#### Niche Public Health Firms

These smaller firms often offer a more mission-driven culture:

- [J Michael Consulting](https://jmichaelconsulting.com/careers/), [Karna](https://www.karna.com/careers/), [Goldbelt](https://www.goldbelt.com/careers/)
- [Chickasaw Nation Industries](https://www.chickasaw.com/careers), [DLH Corp](https://www.dlhcorp.com/careers/)
- [Abt Associates](https://www.abtassociates.com/careers), [JSI (John Snow, Inc.)](https://www.jsi.com/careers/)

**Strategy**: These firms often recruit directly from public health conferences ([CSTE](https://www.cste.org/), [NACCHO](https://www.naccho.org/)). Follow their LinkedIn pages for contract wins.

#### Digital Health and Global Health Tech

These organizations build technology platforms used by health programs worldwide:

- [Dimagi](https://dimagi.com/careers/) (creators of CommCare, a mobile data collection platform)
- [DHIS2](https://dhis2.org/careers/) (the world's largest health management information system)
- [Chaptico Hundred](https://chapticohundred.com/) (purpose-driven consultancy with transformative expertise)
- [Magpie Public Health LLC](https://www.magpieph.com/) (specialists in mixed-methods research and qualitative study design)

**Strategy**: These organizations value professionals who understand both the technology and the public health context in which it operates.

#### NGOs and Nonprofits

- [Task Force for Global Health](https://www.taskforce.org/careers/) (home of [PHII](https://phii.org/who-we-are/join-our-team/))
- [APHL (Association of Public Health Labs)](https://www.aphl.org/aboutAPHL/employment/Pages/default.aspx)
- [ASTHO](https://www.astho.org/about/careers/), [NACCHO](https://www.naccho.org/about/careers)

**Strategy**: These organizations often manage cooperative agreements with the CDC, functioning similarly to contractors but with a nonprofit structure.

::: {.callout-important title="Don't Limit Your Search"}
The employers listed above represent a starting point, not a comprehensive directory. **Any health department, at any level, could benefit from hybrid professionals.** In fact, smaller health departments may lack the expertise to even identify the need for a hybrid professional in the first place. They may not know to advertise for an "Informatics Specialist" because they have never had one.

This creates a unique opportunity: you can approach local health departments proactively, demonstrate how your skills address their data challenges, and help them define a role that did not previously exist. The "hidden" job market is especially fertile in under-resourced settings where the need is greatest but the vocabulary to describe it is absent.
:::

## Decoding Job Descriptions

One of the most significant barriers to entry is the inconsistency of job titles. A "Business Analyst" in a corporate setting might be called a "Public Health Program Specialist II" in a state agency. The hybrid professional must learn to read job descriptions for *skills* and *activities* rather than titles.

### Title-to-Function Mapping

| If You Want To Do... | Search For These Titles... | Look For These Keywords... |
|:---------------------|:---------------------------|:---------------------------|
| **Business Analysis** | Management Analyst, Program Analyst, Operations Coordinator, Product Owner, Systems Analyst | "Requirements gathering," "Workflow analysis," "Process improvement," "Stakeholder liaison," "User stories," "SOP development" |
| **Informatics/Data** | Epidemiologist (Data Systems), Health Scientist, Informatics Specialist, Surveillance Coordinator, Data Manager | "HL7," "ELR" (Electronic Lab Reporting), "Syndromic Surveillance," "Registry," "Interoperability," "FHIR," "Cleaning data" |
| **Project Management** | Public Health Advisor, Program Manager, Implementation Specialist, Grant Manager | "Agile," "Scrum," "Scope management," "Timeline," "Vendor management," "Grant reporting," "Deliverables" |
| **Training/Rollout** | Technical Assistance (TA) Lead, Onboarding Specialist, Implementation Specialist | "User adoption," "Go-live," "Manuals," "Capacity building," "Workforce development" |

### The "Unicorn" Job Description

Often, hiring managers in public health know they need "someone technical" but do not know exactly what that entails. This results in the unicorn job description: a posting that asks for a PhD in Epidemiology, a PMP certification, 10 years of Python coding experience, and a nursing license.

- **The interpretation**: This usually signals a lack of role clarity. The agency has a problem (data) and is listing every possible qualification.
- **The strategy**: Apply if you meet 50 to 60 percent of the criteria.
- **The interview pivot**: Use the interview to perform business analysis on the role itself. Ask: "I see you asked for both Python coding and clinical nursing. Is the primary goal of this role to write the code (Python) or to talk to the nurses who use the system? I excel at the translation between the two." By helping them define the role, you demonstrate your value as a Business Analyst before you are hired.

## Resume and Interview Strategy

To land the job, you must translate your experience into the language of the employer. This requires a "dual-frame" approach.

### The Hybrid Resume

A standard resume is often chronological and mono-lingual (either all tech or all health). A hybrid resume must explicitly bridge the gap.

#### Strategy: The Translation Bullet Point

Rewrite experience to highlight implications for the other domain.

**Public Health professional applying for a Tech/BA role**:

- ❌ *Original*: "Managed the Gonorrhea Surveillance Program."
- ✅ *Translated*: "Managed a disease surveillance system with 5,000+ annual records; acted as **Product Owner** to define reporting requirements for the IT vendor and led **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** for system upgrades."

**Tech/BA professional applying for a Public Health role**:

- ❌ *Original*: "Gathered requirements for SQL database migration."
- ✅ *Translated*: "Facilitated workshops with clinical stakeholders to define data standards for a patient registry; ensured system design complied with **HIPAA privacy regulations** and supported **epidemiological reporting** needs."

#### Strategy: The Dual-Competency Skills Section

Create a skills section that visually separates but presents both domains:

> **Technical & Analysis**: SQL, Tableau, Jira, Visio (BPMN), User Stories, Agile/Scrum
>
> **Public Health & Regulatory**: Epidemiology, Surveillance Systems, HIPAA, HL7/FHIR Standards, CDC Grant Reporting

### The Behavioral Bridge Interview

In an interview, you will often face a panel with mixed backgrounds (e.g., a Program Director and an IT Manager). Your answers must satisfy both.

#### The Bridge Answer Structure

When answering behavioral questions ("Tell me about a time..."), the narrative arc should always be about translation.

**Question**: "Tell me about a time you faced a challenge."

**Bridge Answer**:

1. **Context**: "We had a disconnect where the developers built a feature that did not match the clinical workflow."
2. **Action**: "I scheduled a joint session where I mapped the clinical process on a whiteboard while the developers watched. I translated clinical terms into technical specifications in real time."
3. **Result**: "The developers understood the 'why,' the nurses got a tool that fit their process, and we reduced data entry errors by 50%."

### Questions to Ask the Employer

The questions you ask reveal your sophistication regarding the BA/PH gap.

1. **To the IT Manager**: "How does the development team currently receive input from the epidemiologists? Do you use a specific framework to map public health goals to technical backlogs?"
2. **To the Program Manager**: "How is the success of this IT project being measured? Are we tracking just 'system uptime,' or are we tracking public health metrics like 'time to intervention'?"
3. **The Role-Definition Question**: "Who currently owns the 'translation' between the clinical subject matter experts and the technical vendors? Is that a gap this role is intended to fill?"

## A Note for Hiring Managers

This appendix is primarily for job seekers, but a note for those *hiring* is essential. The "talent shortage" in public health informatics is often a "visibility shortage." The candidates exist, but they are filtered out by rigid requirements.

### Re-Examine Degree Requirements

Do not filter exclusively for MPH or Computer Science degrees. A History major who has spent five years managing a complex nonprofit database often makes an excellent Business Analyst due to their research and synthesis skills.

### Hunt for "Super-Users"

The best future analysts are often currently working inside your organization as nurses, registrars, or administrative assistants. They are the ones who become the "go-to" person for their team's technology problems. They possess the deep domain context that is hardest to teach; technical skills (SQL, Visio) can be taught more easily.

### Use Your Contracts as Signals

If you are a vendor, use your RFP wins as recruitment tools. Advertise that you are "staffing for a newly awarded CDC modernization contract." This signals stability and high-impact work to prospective candidates.

## Quick Reference: Search String Cheat Sheet

Use these strings in Google to identify opportunities. Remember to use Google's date filtering: click **Tools** → **Any time** → **Past week** (for jobs) or **Past month** (for RFPs) to see only recent postings. Alternatively, add `after:2026-01-01` to your search string.

### 1. The Generalist Hybrid Search

This searches inside common HR platforms to find jobs that might not be indexed on aggregators.

::: {.callout-tip title="Applying the Bridgeframe Mindset"}
The job search for a hybrid professional is, in itself, an act of business analysis. It requires analyzing the market (Current State), identifying the gaps where hybrid skills add value (Future State), and designing a strategy (The Application) to bridge that gap.

Whether the journey begins in a rural health department, building foundational knowledge of public health reality, or leverages advanced search operators to uncover a major federal contract, the opportunities are vast. The field of public health is undergoing a massive digital transformation. It does not just need code; it needs context. It needs the Bridgeframe professional.
