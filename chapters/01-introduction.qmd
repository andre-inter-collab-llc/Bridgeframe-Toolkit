# Why Bridgeframe Exists

Public health and information technology are increasingly intertwined. Disease surveillance systems, immunization registries, electronic lab reporting, and health analytics platforms all require collaboration between two groups that often struggle to understand each other: **business analysts** and **public health professionals**.

This chapter explains the problem, introduces the Bridgeframe approach, and sets the stage for the detailed guidance that follows.

## The Silo Problem

Consider a typical scenario: A state health department receives funding to modernize its disease surveillance system. They contract with a software vendor whose project team includes experienced business analysts, developers, and testers. The health department brings epidemiologists, program managers, and data analysts. Both sides are competent in their respective domains. Yet within weeks, the project is mired in confusion.

The vendor's BA asks for "user stories." The epidemiologist provides a detailed case definition document. The BA politely explains that a case definition is not a user story. The epidemiologist wonders why the BA keeps asking about "acceptance criteria" when the CDC already publishes validation rules.

This is not a failure of intelligence or good faith. It is a failure of translation.

## Two Parallel Worlds

Business analysis, as codified in the BABOK (Business Analysis Body of Knowledge), provides a rigorous framework for understanding needs, defining requirements, and ensuring solutions deliver value. Public health analysis, guided by CDC frameworks and epidemiological methods, provides an equally rigorous approach to assessing community needs, designing interventions, and evaluating outcomes.

These frameworks are parallel, not incompatible:

| Business Analysis | Public Health |
|:------------------|:--------------|
| Stakeholder Analysis | Community Partner Mapping |
| Current State Analysis | Epidemiological Baseline |
| Requirements Specification | Program Protocol |
| Solution Design | Intervention Design |
| Implementation | Program Rollout |
| Evaluation | Program Evaluation |

The concepts align; the terminology diverges. Bridgeframe provides the translation layer.

## The Cost of Miscommunication

When BA and PH professionals cannot communicate effectively, projects suffer:

- **Scope creep**: Vague requirements lead to endless revisions
- **Missed requirements**: Critical public health needs get lost in translation
- **Delayed timelines**: Clarification loops consume sprint capacity
- **Poor adoption**: Systems that meet technical specs but fail field workers
- **Wasted funding**: Grant dollars spent on rework rather than outcomes

More importantly, health outcomes suffer. A delayed surveillance system means delayed outbreak response. A poorly designed immunization registry means children missing vaccines.

## The Bridgeframe Solution

Bridgeframe offers a structured approach to bridging these domains:

1. **Common Vocabulary**: Chapter 3 provides a comprehensive dictionary mapping BA terms to PH equivalents
2. **Phase Alignment**: Chapters 4-9 walk through each lifecycle phase, showing how BA activities map to PH frameworks
3. **Practical Examples**: The CancerSurv case study (Chapter 2) demonstrates concepts in action
4. **Implementation Science**: Chapter 11 introduces CFIR and other frameworks for addressing adoption barriers

## Who Should Use This Book

This book serves multiple audiences:

**For IT Business Analysts entering public health:**

- Learn the regulatory context (HIPAA, CDC reporting requirements)
- Understand grant-driven funding and its implications
- Adapt Agile practices for public health workflows

**For Public Health Professionals working with IT teams:**

- Translate your needs into requirements language
- Participate effectively in sprint planning and reviews
- Evaluate vendor proposals with confidence

**For Project Managers and Leaders:**

- Build teams with shared vocabulary
- Anticipate common friction points
- Structure projects for hybrid success

::: {.callout-note title="CancerSurv Example"}
Throughout this book, we follow the CancerSurv project: a state health department modernizing its cancer registry system. In the Introduction, the challenge is framed as both a **Business Need** (replace aging mainframe with modern cloud platform) and a **Public Health Challenge** (ensure timely, complete cancer data for prevention planning and disparity identification).

## What Bridgeframe Is Not

This book does not replace domain-specific training. Business analysts should still study the BABOK and pursue relevant certifications. Public health professionals should still learn epidemiology, biostatistics, and program evaluation. Bridgeframe provides the bridge between these bodies of knowledge, not a substitute for them.

Similarly, this book does not cover software development practices, database design, or clinical medicine in depth. It focuses specifically on the analysis phase: understanding needs, defining requirements, and evaluating solutions.

## Moving Forward

The following chapter introduces CancerSurv in detail, providing the context you will need to engage with examples throughout the book. Chapter 3 then provides the terminology dictionary, a reference you will return to often. From there, we proceed phase by phase through the analysis lifecycle.

Welcome to Bridgeframe. Let us build this bridge together.
