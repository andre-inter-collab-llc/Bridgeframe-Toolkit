## Commercial vs. Open Source/Public Health Tools

Public health agencies often operate with constrained budgets while managing sensitive health data. This chapter compares commercial enterprise tools with open source and public health-specific alternatives, helping you select the right tools for your context.

### Selection Criteria

When evaluating tools, consider:

| Criterion | Commercial Advantage | OSS/PH Advantage |
|:----------|:---------------------|:-----------------|
| **Cost** | Predictable licensing | No license fees |
| **Support** | Vendor SLAs | Community + self-reliance |
| **Features** | Polished, integrated | Customizable, extensible |
| **Compliance** | Often pre-certified | Full control over data |
| **Data Sovereignty** | Vendor-managed | Organization-controlled |
| **Sustainability** | Vendor roadmap | Community-driven |

### Tool Categories

#### Project Management

| Capability | Commercial Options | OSS/PH Options |
|:-----------|:-------------------|:---------------|
| **Full PM Suite** | Jira, Azure DevOps, MS Project | OpenProject, Redmine, Taiga |
| **Kanban Boards** | Trello (paid), Monday.com | Trello (free tier), Wekan, Kanboard |
| **Agile Planning** | Jira, Rally, VersionOne | Taiga, OpenProject |
| **Grant Management** | Smartsheet, Asana | OpenProject with custom fields |

**Recommendation for Public Health:**

- **Small teams (<10):** Trello free tier or Taiga for simple Kanban/Scrum
- **Larger programs:** OpenProject for full PM capabilities with data sovereignty
- **CDC/Federal projects:** Often require Azure DevOps or Jira per contract

::: {.callout-tip title="When to Choose OSS"}
Choose open source when:

- Budget is constrained
- Data sovereignty is critical (cannot store project data externally)
- Technical staff can support installation and maintenance
- Customization is needed beyond commercial options

library(epitools)
library(tidyverse)

cancer_data %>%
  group_by(county, year) %>%
  summarize(
    cases = n(),
    population = first(population),
    crude_rate = cases / population * 100000
  ) %>%
  # Age adjustment using standard population
  ageadjust.direct(count = cases, pop = population, stdpop = us_std_pop)
```

#### Visualization

### Considerations for Tool Selection

#### Total Cost of Ownership

Free software is not always cheaper:

| Cost Factor | Commercial | Open Source |
|:------------|:-----------|:------------|
| License fees | Yes | No |
| Implementation | Vendor/partner | Internal/consultant |
| Training | Often included | Self-directed or purchased |
| Support | Included in license | Community or purchased |
| Customization | Limited | Unlimited but costly |
| Infrastructure | Cloud included or on-prem | You manage |

#### Compliance and Security

| Consideration | Commercial | Open Source |
|:--------------|:-----------|:------------|
| HIPAA compliance | Often certified | Your responsibility to configure |
| SOC 2 certification | Common | Rare; your responsibility |
| Security updates | Vendor manages | You monitor and apply |
| Audit trails | Built-in | May require configuration |

#### Sustainability

Consider long-term viability:

- Commercial: Vendor may be acquired, change pricing, sunset product
- Open Source: Community may lose momentum; check activity levels
- Hybrid: Consider tools with both commercial and open source options

### Summary

The choice between commercial and open source tools depends on your context: budget, technical capacity, data sensitivity, and compliance requirements. Public health has excellent open source options, particularly for data collection (REDCap), analysis (R), mapping (QGIS), and integration (Mirth Connect). Evaluate total cost of ownership, not just license fees.
