## Optimizing for Impact

Business analysts and public health analysts share a fundamental responsibility: identifying inefficiencies and optimizing processes to maximize program impact. Whether measuring return on investment (BA) or population health outcomes (PH), both domains must demonstrate tangible value. In public health, that value must ultimately be apparent to the taxpayer funding these programs.

This chapter synthesizes strategies from psychology, sociology, project management, informatics, and organizational behavior to create a comprehensive approach to process optimization.

### The Dual Framework

| BA Perspective | PH Perspective |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| Process Improvement | Program Optimization |
| Operational Efficiency | Resource Stewardship |
| ROI Demonstration | Taxpayer Value |
| Automation Strategy | Scalable Interventions |
| Change Management | Implementation Science |

### The Optimization Hierarchy

Before optimizing a process, apply this decision framework:

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-optimization-hierarchy
%%| fig-cap: "Process Optimization Decision Tree"
flowchart TD
    A[Identify Manual Process] --> B{Mission Critical?}
    B -->|No| C[Eliminate]
    B -->|Yes| D{Can It Be Automated?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Automate with Oversight]
    D -->|No| F[Standardize & Document]
    E --> G{Scalable?}
    F --> G
    G -->|Yes| H[Implement]
    G -->|No| I[Reassess Requirements]
```

::: {.callout-important title="Core Principle"}
**Automation and scale should be prioritized above aesthetics.** A functional, scalable system that processes 10,000 records reliably is more valuable than a beautifully designed system that handles 100. Invest in robustness first; polish later.
:::

## Foundations of Organizational Efficiency

### Psychological Foundations

Understanding human motivation and well-being is essential for sustainable process improvement. Optimizing systems without considering the people who operate them leads to burnout, resistance, and ultimately failure.

#### Self-Determination Theory (SDT)

Deci and Ryan's Self-Determination Theory identifies three innate psychological needs that drive motivation:

| Need | Description | Process Implication |
|:-----|:------------|:--------------------|
| **Autonomy** | Control over one's work | Allow flexibility in *how* tasks are completed |
| **Competence** | Mastery and effectiveness | Provide training, feedback, and achievable challenges |
| **Relatedness** | Connection to others | Foster team collaboration and shared purpose |

**Application to Process Design:**

- Automated systems should augment, not replace, human decision-making
- Staff should understand *why* processes exist, not just *how* to follow them
- Build in opportunities for skill development as systems evolve

#### Barriers and Remedies

Common human-factor barriers that undermine optimization and efficiency, with practical alternatives:

| Barrier | Impact | Productive Alternative |
|:--------|:-------|:-----------------------|
| Bullying or intimidation | Silence, errors hidden, low reporting | Psychological safety commitment, enforce anti-bullying policy, anonymous feedback channels |
| Poor communication styles | Misunderstandings, rework | Use structured communication (SBAR), active listening, clarify decisions and rationales |
| Personality pathology concerns | Unpredictable decisions, fear-based culture | Focus on observable behaviors, set conduct standards, escalate through HR and governance mechanisms |
| Leadership lacking domain expertise | Misprioritized work, unrealistic expectations | Pair leaders with SMEs, decision review gates, domain briefings |
| Resistance to change | Slow adoption, shadow work | Co-design with users, pilots, training, incentives for adoption |

#### Psychological Safety

Amy Edmondson's research on psychological safety demonstrates that teams perform better when members feel safe to take risks, ask questions, and admit mistakes without fear of punishment.

| Safety Element | Process Design Implication |
|:---------------|:---------------------------|
| **Speaking up** | Create feedback channels for process improvements |
| **Risk-taking** | Allow experimentation with PDSA cycles |
| **Mistake tolerance** | Design systems with error recovery, not just prevention |
| **Help-seeking** | Document processes so staff can learn independently |

::: {.callout-note title="CancerSurv Example"}
When implementing CancerSurv, the state registry created a "no-blame" error reporting system. Registrars could flag data quality issues or workflow problems without fear of criticism. This resulted in:

- 47% more process improvement suggestions in the first quarter
- Identification of a critical duplicate detection gap that would have affected NPCR submission
- Higher staff satisfaction scores (3.2 → 4.1 on 5-point scale)
:::

#### Job Demands-Resources Model

The JD-R model explains that job stress results from imbalance between demands and resources:

| Job Demands | Job Resources |
|:------------|:--------------|
| Workload | Autonomy |
| Time pressure | Social support |
| Complexity | Feedback |
| Ambiguity | Growth opportunities |

**Process optimization should reduce demands while maintaining or increasing resources.** Automation that simply increases throughput expectations without adding support leads to burnout.

::: {.callout-tip title="Human-Factor Guardrails"}
Design processes that protect well-being:

- Set realistic throughput targets aligned to available resources
- Provide recovery mechanisms when errors occur
- Rotate high-stress tasks to avoid fatigue concentration
- Include regular check-ins focused on workload and support needs
:::

### Sociological Foundations

Organizations are social systems. Process changes must account for group dynamics, power structures, and cultural norms.

#### Organizational Culture (Schein)

Edgar Schein's model describes three levels of organizational culture:

1. **Artifacts**: Visible structures and processes (what we see)
2. **Espoused Values**: Stated strategies and goals (what we say)
3. **Basic Assumptions**: Unconscious beliefs (what we actually believe)

Process optimization often fails when it addresses only artifacts while conflicting with basic assumptions. A new data system requiring transparency may fail in an organization where the underlying assumption is "information is power."

#### Barriers and Remedies

| Barrier | Impact | Productive Alternative |
|:--------|:-------|:-----------------------|
| Unhealthy competition | Siloing, information hoarding | Shared goals, team-based incentives, cross-team reviews |
| Political factors | Decisions driven by influence not evidence | Transparent criteria, documented decision logs, conflict-of-interest declarations |
| Misalignment across teams | Duplicate work, conflicting priorities | Cascading OKRs, logic model alignment, shared roadmaps |
| Isolation of opposing views | Blind spots, low trust | Structured dissent, red teaming, inclusive facilitation |
| Tendency to self-appoint leaders | Fragmented efforts | Define RACI, appoint accountable owner, encourage collaborative leadership |

#### Communities of Practice

Wenger's Communities of Practice (CoP) concept describes how learning and knowledge sharing occur through social participation:

| CoP Element | Application to Process Optimization |
|:------------|:------------------------------------|
| **Domain** | Shared competence (e.g., data quality) |
| **Community** | Members who interact and learn together |
| **Practice** | Shared resources, tools, and approaches |

**Establish cross-functional communities** to prevent silos and ensure process improvements are adopted across the organization.

#### Deduplication of Effort

One of the most significant inefficiencies in organizations is duplicated work: multiple teams solving the same problem independently. This represents wasted resources and inconsistent outcomes.

| Problem | Solution | Mechanism |
|:--------|:---------|:----------|
| Multiple teams cleaning the same data | Centralized data team | Shared Bronze/Silver data layers |
| Parallel development of similar tools | Internal tool registry | Searchable repository of existing solutions |
| Reinventing processes | Process documentation | Wiki/knowledge base with templates |
| Redundant meetings | Meeting audit | Regular review of recurring meetings |

::: {.callout-tip title="Centralization Principle"}
**Core functions should be centralized.** If multiple groups rely on the same data, that data should be centrally stored, cleaned, and documented. This ensures consistency, reduces duplicate effort, and allows specialized expertise to develop.

Examples of centralizable functions:

- Data cleaning and standardization
- Report generation and dissemination
- Training material development
- Compliance documentation
:::

::: {.callout-warning title="Silo Risks"}
Deduplication fails when:

- Goals and definitions differ across teams
- Shared repositories lack findability or curation
- Incentives reward local optimization over system impact

Remedies: establish taxonomy and metadata standards, maintain an internal tool registry, and set a review cadence for shared assets.
:::

### Project Management Frameworks

Effective process optimization requires disciplined project management. Choose frameworks appropriate to your context.

#### Framework Comparison

| Framework | Best For | Key Features |
|:----------|:---------|:-------------|
| **Agile/Scrum** | Evolving requirements, software | Iterative, adaptive, team-based |
| **Kanban** | Continuous flow, operations | Visual, WIP limits, pull-based |
| **Waterfall** | Fixed requirements, compliance | Sequential, documented, predictable |
| **Hybrid** | Public health programs | Grant milestones + iterative delivery |

#### Project Management Tools

| Capability | Commercial Options | OSS/PH Options |
|:-----------|:-------------------|:---------------|
| **Full PM Suite** | Jira, Azure DevOps, MS Project | [OpenProject](https://www.openproject.org/), [Taiga](https://www.taiga.io/) |
| **Kanban Boards** | Trello (paid), Monday.com | Trello (free tier), [Wekan](https://wekan.github.io/) |
| **Task Management** | Asana, ClickUp | [Nextcloud Tasks](https://nextcloud.com/), GitHub Issues |
| **Communication** | Slack, MS Teams | [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/), [Zulip](https://zulip.com/) |

::: {.callout-important title="Tool Selection Criteria"}
When selecting project management tools:

1. **Visibility**: Everyone should know goals, objectives, roles, and responsibilities
2. **Accountability**: Tasks should have clear owners and deadlines
3. **Integration**: Tools should connect to reduce manual status updates
4. **Accessibility**: All team members should be able to access and use the system
5. **Data sovereignty**: Consider where project data is stored, especially for sensitive public health programs
:::

#### The Iterative Imperative

**Avoid spending months developing systems that do not meet critical needs.** Systems should be iteratively developed with priority functionality assessed at each step.

| Anti-Pattern | Better Approach |
|:-------------|:----------------|
| 12-month development before user feedback | 2-week sprints with demos |
| Complete feature set before release | MVP with core functionality first |
| Comprehensive documentation before coding | Just-in-time documentation |
| Perfect architecture upfront | Evolutionary architecture |

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-iterative-development
%%| fig-cap: "Iterative Development with Value Assessment"

    A[Identify Priority<br/>Functionality] --> B[Develop<br/>Increment]
    B --> C[Deploy &<br/>Gather Feedback]
    C --> D{Delivering<br/>Value?}

    D -->|No| F[Pivot or<br/>Discontinue]
    E --> A
    F --> G[Lessons<br/>Learned]
```

#### Barriers and Remedies

| Barrier | Impact | Productive Alternative |
|:--------|:-------|:-----------------------|
| Poor leadership | Drifting scope, low morale | Clear charter, coaching, governance oversight |
| No clear goals | Scattershot work, weak value | Define measurable outcomes, adopt OKRs, align to logic model |
| Disorganization | Missed deadlines, rework | Lightweight rituals, visual management, cadence of planning and review |
| Misalignment | Conflicts and duplication | Cross-functional prioritization, single backlog, dependency mapping |
| Overemphasis on aesthetics | Delayed value, brittle systems | Prioritize scalability and reliability, postpone polish until core value delivered |
| Unrealistic expectations | Burnout, low quality, failed delivery | Evidence-based estimation (velocity/throughput), align targets to capacity, set realistic SLAs |
| Shifting expectations (scope creep) | Churn, constant rework | Formal change control, backlog refinement, decision logs, re-baselining with stakeholder sign-off |

### Communication and Transparency

Clear communication is the foundation of organizational efficiency. Teams cannot avoid duplicating work if they do not know what others are doing.

#### Communication Hierarchy

| Level | Content | Frequency | Tool |
|:------|:--------|:----------|:-----|
| **Strategic** | Goals, priorities, resource allocation | Quarterly | All-hands, leadership memo |
| **Tactical** | Project status, blockers, decisions | Weekly | Team meetings, PM tool |
| **Operational** | Task updates, questions, collaboration | Daily | Chat, task comments |
| **Ad-hoc** | Urgent issues, clarifications | As needed | Direct message, huddle |

#### RACI Matrix for Process Clarity

Define roles clearly to prevent gaps and overlaps:

| Role | Definition |
|:-----|:-----------|
| **Responsible** | Does the work |
| **Accountable** | Ultimately answerable (one person only) |
| **Consulted** | Provides input |
| **Informed** | Kept updated |

::: {.callout-note title="CancerSurv Example"}
**RACI for Data Quality Process:**

| Activity | Data Analyst | Data Manager | Epidemiologist | IT Support |
|:---------|:------------:|:------------:|:--------------:|:----------:|
| Receive hospital files | I | R | I | C |
| Validate file format | C | R | I | A |
| Clean demographic data | R | C | I | I |
| Apply edits/business rules | R | C | A | I |
| Generate quality report | R | I | A | I |
| Resolve data issues | R | C | A | C |
:::

#### Poor Styles and Productive Alternatives

| Poor Style | Typical Outcome | Productive Alternative |
|:-----------|:----------------|:-----------------------|
| Vague updates | Confusion, rework | SBAR: Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation |
| One-way broadcasting | Low engagement | Active listening, solicit questions, summarize decisions |
| Unstructured meetings | Time waste | Agenda with objectives, timeboxing, clear next steps |
| Email-only coordination | Slow, fragmented | Use shared PM tool, threaded discussions, decision logs |
| Public criticism | Fear, silence | Private coaching, focus on behaviors, reinforce norms |

### Educational Foundations

Process optimization requires ongoing learning and skill development.

#### Adult Learning Principles (Andragogy)

Malcolm Knowles identified key principles for adult learners:

| Principle | Application |
|:----------|:------------|
| **Self-directed** | Provide resources for independent learning |
| **Experience-based** | Connect new processes to existing knowledge |
| **Relevance-oriented** | Explain *why* processes matter |
| **Problem-centered** | Frame training around real challenges |
| **Internally motivated** | Appeal to professional growth, not just compliance |

#### Building Technical Capacity

**Desktop data management tasks should be scripted.** Manual data cleaning in spreadsheets is error-prone, non-reproducible, and does not scale.

| Manual Approach | Scripted Approach |
|:----------------|:------------------|
| Copy-paste in Excel | R/Python script |
| Point-and-click transformations | Documented code |
| "I remember how I did it" | Version-controlled workflow |
| One person can do it | Anyone can run it |

::: {.callout-tip title="Learning Path Recommendation"}
Encourage all analysts to learn basic programming:

1. **Start with R or Python**: Both are free, well-documented, and widely used
2. **Focus on data manipulation first**: tidyverse (R) or pandas (Python)
3. **Learn version control**: Git fundamentals for collaboration
4. **Build incrementally**: Automate one task at a time
5. **Share and document**: Create institutional knowledge

**Recommended resources:**

- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) (free online book)
- [Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/) (O'Reilly)
- [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) (workshops for researchers)
:::

#### Barriers and Remedies

| Barrier | Impact | Productive Alternative |
|:--------|:-------|:-----------------------|
| Leadership lacks domain expertise | Misguided priorities | SME pairing, domain briefings, review gates |
| Training not prioritized | Skill gaps persist | Microlearning, on-the-job practice, mentorship programs |
| Tool phobia | Manual work persists | Low-stakes practice environments, peer support, success stories |
| Knowledge silos | Rework, inconsistent methods | Shared curricula, brown-bag sessions, internal certifications |

## Automation Strategy

### The Automation Spectrum

Not all automation is equal. Consider the level appropriate for each process:

| Level | Description | Example | Human Role |
|:------|:------------|:--------|:-----------|
| **Manual** | Human does all work | Ad-hoc data requests | Full control |
| **Assisted** | Tools support human work | Spell-check, templates | Decision-maker |
| **Partial** | System handles routine; human handles exceptions | Auto-coding with review queue | Exception handler |
| **Conditional** | System does most; human monitors | Scheduled reports with alerts | Supervisor |
| **Full** | System operates independently | Automated backups | Oversight only |

### Automation with Accountability

**Systems that are automated sometimes miss critical requirements.** Automated systems should be flexible enough to adjust to evolving demands.

| Requirement | Implementation |
|:------------|:---------------|
| **Flexibility** | Configurable rules, not hard-coded logic |
| **Auditability** | Logging of all automated decisions |
| **Override capability** | Human can intervene when needed |
| **Feedback loops** | Mechanism to report automation failures |
| **Version control** | Track changes to automation rules |

#### The AI Accountability Challenge

Artificial intelligence presents unique challenges for process automation:

| AI Challenge | Mitigation Strategy |
|:-------------|:--------------------|
| **Lack of accountability** | Assign human owner for AI-assisted decisions |
| **Inconsistent reliability** | Implement confidence thresholds and fallback processes |
| **Volume of output** | Train more reviewers; focus review on high-risk items |
| **Opacity ("black box")** | Require explainable AI or human decision for critical paths |
| **Drift over time** | Regular performance monitoring and recalibration |

::: {.callout-warning title="AI Oversight Principle"}
**There should always be someone who reviews critical operations.** AI can accelerate work, but lacks the accountability and judgment required for consequential decisions.

The challenge: humans cannot review the vast amounts of AI-generated output. Solutions include:

- **Risk-based review**: Focus human attention on high-stakes decisions
- **Sampling**: Statistically valid review of AI output subsets
- **Building reviewer capacity**: Train more staff to critically evaluate AI outputs
- **Automated validation**: Use rule-based systems to catch obvious AI errors
:::

#### Barriers and Remedies

| Barrier | Impact | Productive Alternative |
|:--------|:-------|:-----------------------|
| Resistance to tool adoption | Parallel manual processes | Co-design with end users, pilot features, champions and super-users |
| Rigid automation | Missed requirements | Configurable rules, human override, rapid iteration |
| Opaque AI decisions | Low trust | Explainability requirements, confidence thresholds, fallback to human review |
| Over-automation | Fragility, brittleness | Keep humans in the loop for exception handling, monitor and recalibrate |

### Scripting Desktop Tasks

Transform manual data management into reproducible workflows:

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-script-workflow
%%| fig-cap: "From Manual to Scripted Data Workflow"
flowchart LR
    subgraph Manual["Manual Process"]
        M1[Open Excel] --> M2[Copy data]
        M2 --> M3[Clean manually]
        M3 --> M4[Format output]
        M4 --> M5[Email results]
    end
    
    subgraph Scripted["Scripted Process"]
        S1[Run script] --> S2[Auto-clean]
        S2 --> S3[Generate report]
        S3 --> S4[Archive & notify]
    end
    
    Manual -->|Transform| Scripted
```

**Benefits of scripted workflows:**

| Benefit | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| **Reproducibility** | Same code produces same results |
| **Auditability** | Code documents exactly what was done |
| **Scalability** | Process 10 or 10,000 records identically |
| **Error reduction** | Eliminates copy-paste mistakes |
| **Knowledge transfer** | New staff can run existing scripts |

## Centralization and Shared Services

### The Medallion Architecture for Shared Data

When multiple teams rely on the same data, implement a centralized data architecture:

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-shared-data
%%| fig-cap: "Centralized Data Architecture"
flowchart LR
    subgraph Sources["Data Sources"]
        H[Hospitals]
        L[Labs]
        V[Vital Records]
    end
    
    subgraph Central["Centralized Data Team"]
        B[(Bronze<br/>Raw Data)]
        S[(Silver<br/>Cleaned Data)]
        G[(Gold<br/>Analysis-Ready)]
    end
    
    subgraph Consumers["Data Consumers"]
        E[Epidemiologists]
        R[Registrars]
        A[Analysts]
        P[Program Staff]
    end
    
    H --> B
    L --> B
    V --> B
    B --> S
    S --> G
    G --> E
    G --> R
    G --> A
    G --> P
```

**Centralization benefits:**

- **Consistency**: All consumers use the same cleaned data
- **Expertise**: Data team develops specialized cleaning skills
- **Efficiency**: Clean once, use many times
- **Quality**: Single point of accountability for data quality

### Shared Services Model

Extend centralization beyond data to other core functions:

| Function | Centralized Model | Benefits |
|:---------|:------------------|:---------|
| **Data cleaning** | Central data team maintains Silver layer | Consistent quality, reduced duplication |
| **Report generation** | Shared reporting infrastructure | Standard formats, automated distribution |
| **Training development** | Central learning team | Consistent messaging, professional quality |
| **Compliance documentation** | Compliance office coordinates | Complete coverage, expert interpretation |
| **Tool administration** | IT manages shared tools | Security, licensing, support |

## Establishing Accountability Structures

### Clear Governance

**Clear structures should be in place to ensure responsibility and accountability.** Without governance, process improvements drift and deteriorate.

| Governance Element | Purpose | Example |
|:-------------------|:--------|:--------|
| **Process owner** | Single point of accountability | Data Quality Manager |
| **Steering committee** | Strategic decisions, resource allocation | Monthly leadership review |
| **Working groups** | Operational improvements | Data Quality Working Group |
| **SLAs/OLAs** | Documented expectations | 99.9% uptime, 48-hour response |
| **Escalation paths** | Clear routes for unresolved issues | Analyst → Manager → Director |

### Metrics and Monitoring

What gets measured gets managed. Establish metrics for process performance:

| Metric Category | Examples |
|:----------------|:---------|
| **Efficiency** | Time per task, throughput, backlog size |
| **Quality** | Error rates, rework rates, audit findings |
| **Adoption** | Usage rates, training completion, feedback scores |
| **Value** | Cost savings, time saved, outcomes improved |

::: {.callout-note title="CancerSurv Example"}
**Process Optimization Dashboard:**

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Current | Status |
|:-------|:---------|:-------|:--------|:-------|
| Case abstraction time | 15 min | 8 min | 9.2 min | 🟡 |
| Data completeness | 89% | 95% | 94.3% | 🟡 |
| Duplicate detection rate | 73% | 95% | 96.1% | 🟢 |
| Hospital submission lag | 14 days | 7 days | 5.2 days | 🟢 |
| Manual interventions/week | 127 | 50 | 43 | 🟢 |
| Staff satisfaction | 3.2/5 | 4.0/5 | 4.1/5 | 🟢 |

The dashboard is reviewed weekly by the Data Quality Working Group and monthly by the program steering committee.
:::

#### Barriers and Remedies

| Barrier | Impact | Productive Alternative |
|:--------|:-------|:-----------------------|
| Political factors | Decision volatility | Charter governance, transparent criteria, external audit where appropriate |
| Ambiguous accountability | Tasks dropped | Assign process owner, document SLAs, clear escalation paths |
| Goal drift | Lost value | Quarterly goal review, traceability to logic model and grant objectives |
| Fragmented oversight | Conflicting directives | Single steering committee, integrated calendars, unified reporting cadence |

### Integration Checklist

When optimizing processes, ensure you address all dimensions:

| Dimension | Questions to Ask |
|:----------|:-----------------|
| **Psychology** | Does this support autonomy, competence, and relatedness? Is the environment psychologically safe? |
| **Sociology** | Does this align with organizational culture? Are communities of practice engaged? |
| **Project Management** | Is there a clear plan with milestones? Are tools appropriate? |
| **Communication** | Do all stakeholders know the goals, roles, and status? |
| **Education** | Do staff have the skills needed? Is training available? |
| **Centralization** | Are core functions appropriately centralized? Is duplication minimized? |
| **Automation** | Is the right level of automation applied? Is there human oversight? |
| **Accountability** | Are governance structures clear? Are metrics tracked? |

### The Public Health Value Proposition

Ultimately, process optimization in public health must demonstrate value to the taxpayer. Every efficiency gain should connect to improved health outcomes:

| Efficiency Gain | Taxpayer Value |
|:----------------|:---------------|
| Faster data processing | Earlier outbreak detection |
| Reduced manual errors | More accurate surveillance |
| Automated reporting | More resources for intervention |
| Streamlined workflows | Lower cost per case processed |
| Better data quality | More reliable public health decisions |

::: {.callout-important title="The Accountability Test"}
For every process, ask: **"Could I explain to a taxpayer why this is necessary and how it contributes to public health?"**

If the answer is no, the process should be eliminated, automated, or fundamentally redesigned.
:::

## Summary

Process optimization requires a multidisciplinary approach:

1. **Understand human factors**: Motivation, safety, and well-being drive sustainable improvement
2. **Address organizational dynamics**: Culture, communities, and communication enable or inhibit change
3. **Apply disciplined management**: Iterative development, clear accountability, and appropriate tools
4. **Automate thoughtfully**: Prioritize scalability and flexibility; maintain human oversight
5. **Centralize core functions**: Reduce duplication; build expertise
6. **Demonstrate value**: Connect every optimization to taxpayer value and health outcomes

The goal is not efficiency for its own sake, but rather **maximizing public health impact with the resources entrusted to us**.
