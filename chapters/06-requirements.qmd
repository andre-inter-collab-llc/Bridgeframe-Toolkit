## Requirements Analysis & Data Analysis

Raw elicitation findings must be organized, analyzed, and specified in detail. In business analysis, this is **Requirements Analysis and Design Definition**. In public health, it maps to **Data Analysis** and **Logic Model Development**. Both processes transform unstructured input into structured, actionable specifications.

### The Dual Framework

| BA Perspective | PH Perspective |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| Requirements Analysis | Data Analysis |
| Requirements Specification | Logic Model / Theory of Change |
| Functional Requirements | Program Activities |
| Non-Functional Requirements | Implementation Characteristics |
| Data Requirements | Case Definitions, Data Dictionaries |
| Business Rules | Clinical Guidelines, Protocols |

### Types of Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

**BA Definition:** What the system must do. Capabilities, features, functions.

**PH Equivalent:** Program activities, intervention components, service delivery specifications.

::: {.callout-note title="CancerSurv Example"}
**Functional Requirement (BA format):**

> FR-101: The system shall allow users to search for cases by patient name, medical record number, or social security number.

**Program Activity (PH format):**

> Cancer registrars will abstract and code incident cases from hospital pathology reports within 6 months of diagnosis date.

Both describe "what happens" but at different levels of specificity.
:::

#### Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

**BA Definition:** Quality attributes, constraints, performance characteristics.

**PH Equivalent:** Implementation characteristics (per CFIR framework).

| NFR Category | BA Focus | PH Focus (CFIR Domain) |
|:-------------|:---------|:-----------------------|
| **Performance** | Response time, throughput | Efficiency of intervention delivery |
| **Security** | Access control, encryption | HIPAA compliance, trust |
| **Scalability** | Growth capacity | Outbreak surge response |
| **Usability** | User interface design | Complexity, ease of adoption |
| **Reliability** | Uptime, fault tolerance | Service continuity |
| **Interoperability** | API standards, data exchange | Health information exchange |

::: {.callout-note title="CancerSurv Example"}
**NFR (BA format):**

> NFR-201: The system shall maintain 99.9% uptime during business hours (8 AM to 6 PM Eastern).

**Implementation Characteristic (PH format):**

> The CancerSurv platform must demonstrate high reliability to maintain registrar confidence and ensure continuous data collection, critical during cancer awareness campaigns when reporting volumes increase.
:::

#### Data Requirements

Data specifications are central to both domains:

**BA Data Model:**

- Entity-Relationship diagrams
- Database schemas
- Data dictionaries
- Validation rules

**PH Case Definitions:**

- Diagnostic criteria
- Inclusion/exclusion criteria
- Coding standards (ICD-O-3, TNM)
- Data quality metrics

    PATIENT {
        string patient_id PK
        string name
        date birth_date
        string ssn
        string address
    }
    
    TUMOR {
        string tumor_id PK
        string patient_id FK
        date diagnosis_date
        string primary_site
        string histology
        string stage
    }
```

#### Business Rules / Clinical Guidelines

Rules governing system behavior and data processing:

| BA Business Rule | PH Clinical Guideline |
|:-----------------|:----------------------|
| "Order cannot be placed if credit limit exceeded" | "Case is reportable if primary site is within state jurisdiction" |
| "Discount applies if quantity > 100" | "Stage is unknown if pathology report unavailable within 4 months" |
| "Manager approval required for refunds > $500" | "Multiple primary rules apply per SEER guidelines" |

### Data Standards as Primary Requirements

In commercial software projects, data standards (file formats, API specifications, integration protocols) are often treated as technical details to be resolved by developers during implementation. In public health IT, this approach fails.

**Data standards are primary business requirements, not optional technical details.**

Health information systems operate within a regulatory and interoperability landscape where specific standards are mandated, not merely preferred. These standards should be identified and documented early, during requirements analysis, not deferred to design or implementation.

| Standard | Purpose | Requirement Implication |
|:---------|:--------|:------------------------|
| **HIPAA** | Privacy and security | Security architecture, access controls, audit logging |
| **HL7 v2** | Message-based data exchange | Interface specifications for lab results, ADT events |
| **HL7 FHIR** | Modern API-based exchange | RESTful API design for EHR integration |
| **USCDI** | Federal data interoperability | Required data classes for ONC certification |
| **ICD-10 / ICD-O-3** | Diagnosis and oncology coding | Validation rules, lookup tables, code mapping |
| **SNOMED CT** | Clinical terminology | Concept mapping specifications |
| **LOINC** | Laboratory test coding | Interface specifications for electronic lab reporting |
| **NAACCR** | Cancer registry standards | Data dictionary, edit checks, submission formats |

::: {.callout-warning title="Common Pitfall"}
When data standards are not identified as requirements, projects encounter costly surprises during integration testing. A system that functions correctly in isolation may fail when connected to external systems that expect specific data formats, codes, or protocols.

For business analysts entering public health IT: treat data standards as \"Must Have\" requirements from day one. Interview stakeholders about external data exchanges early, and document the specific standards each interface requires.
:::

::: {.callout-note title="CancerSurv Example"}
**Standards-Based Requirements for CancerSurv:**

| Standard | CancerSurv Requirement |
|:---------|:-----------------------|
| HIPAA | All PHI encrypted at rest and in transit; role-based access; 6-year audit log retention |
| HL7 FHIR | Patient, Condition, and Observation resources for hospital EHR integration |
| NAACCR v24 | All required data items; automated EDITS validation; annual submission file generation |
| ICD-O-3 | Validated primary site and histology codes with cross-validation rules |
| LOINC | Mapping table for incoming electronic pathology reports |

These standards-based requirements appeared in the CancerSurv requirements specification alongside functional requirements, with the same priority and traceability as any other \"Must Have\" item.

### The Logic Model as Requirements Framework

Public health uses the **Logic Model** to specify program components. This structure maps directly to requirements categories:

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-logic-requirements
%%| fig-cap: "Logic Model Components Mapped to Requirements"
flowchart LR
    subgraph Inputs[" "]
        I["**Inputs**<br/>(Resources)<br/>───────<br/>Funding<br/>Staff<br/>Data feeds<br/>Infrastructure"]
    end
    
    subgraph Activities[" "]
        A["**Activities**<br/>(Functions)<br/>───────<br/>Case abstraction<br/>Data quality<br/>Reporting<br/>Analytics"]
    end
    
    subgraph Outputs[" "]
        O["**Outputs**<br/>(Deliverables)<br/>───────<br/>Case records<br/>Quality reports<br/>NPCR submissions<br/>Dashboards"]
    end
    
    subgraph Outcomes[" "]
        OC["**Outcomes**<br/>(Success Metrics)<br/>───────<br/>95% completeness<br/>Timely reporting<br/>User satisfaction"]
    end
    
    I --> A --> O --> OC
```

| Logic Model Component | Requirements Category |
|:----------------------|:----------------------|
| Inputs | Constraints, Assumptions, Dependencies |
| Activities | Functional Requirements |
| Outputs | System Deliverables, Features |
| Outcomes | Success Metrics, Acceptance Criteria |
| Impact | Strategic Objectives, Business Value |

### Prioritization

#### Methods for Ranking Requirements

Not all requirements are equal. Prioritization ensures critical needs are addressed first:

**MoSCoW Method:**

- **Must have**: Essential for go-live
- **Should have**: Important but not critical
- **Could have**: Desirable if time permits
- **Won't have**: Out of scope for this release

**Weighted Scoring:**

Assign weights to criteria (business value, regulatory requirement, user impact) and score each requirement.

**Kano Model:**

- Basic needs (expected, cause dissatisfaction if missing)
- Performance needs (more is better)
- Delighters (unexpected features that excite)

::: {.callout-note title="CancerSurv Example"}
**Must Have:**

- Case entry and coding functionality
- HIPAA-compliant security
- NPCR data submission capability

**Should Have:**

- Real-time analytics dashboard
- Mobile-friendly interface
- Automated duplicate detection

**Could Have:**

- Machine learning for coding assistance
- Patient portal for self-reported outcomes
- Integration with research databases
:::

### Requirements Traceability

#### Linking Requirements to Objectives

Traceability ensures every requirement connects to a business need or program goal:

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-traceability
%%| fig-cap: "Requirements Traceability Structure"
flowchart TB
    BN[Business Need /<br/>Program Goal] --> FR[Functional<br/>Requirement]
    BN --> NFR[Non-Functional<br/>Requirement]
    FR --> TC[Test Case]
    NFR --> TC
    FR --> US[User Story]
    TC --> TR[Test Result]
```

**Traceability Matrix Example:**

| Requirement ID | Description | Source | Priority | Test Case |
|:---------------|:------------|:-------|:---------|:----------|
| FR-101 | Case search functionality | Registrar interviews | Must | TC-101, TC-102 |
| FR-102 | ICD-O-3 coding validation | NAACCR standards | Must | TC-103 |
| NFR-201 | 99.9% uptime | SLA requirements | Must | TC-201 |

### Specification Formats

#### Writing Good Requirements

Regardless of format, good requirements share characteristics:

| Characteristic | Description | Example |
|:---------------|:------------|:--------|
| **Complete** | Contains all necessary information | Includes error handling, edge cases |
| **Consistent** | Does not contradict other requirements | Uses standard terminology |
| **Unambiguous** | Only one interpretation possible | "Within 3 seconds" not "quickly" |
| **Verifiable** | Can be tested | Measurable acceptance criteria |
| **Traceable** | Links to source and test | Includes requirement ID |

#### User Story Format

For Agile projects:

> As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit].

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Given [context], when [action], then [result]

#### GPS Format for Clinical Contexts

> Given [clinical context], the [health worker role] should [specific action] to [health outcome].

::: {.callout-note title="CancerSurv Example"}
**User Story:**

> As a cancer registrar, I want to search for existing cases before creating a new record, so that I avoid creating duplicate entries.

**GPS Format:**

> Given a new pathology report, the registrar should search existing cases by patient identifiers before abstracting, to maintain data integrity and accurate incidence counts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Given a patient name, when the registrar searches, then matching cases display within 3 seconds
- Given a patient with no existing cases, when the registrar searches, then a "No matches found" message displays with option to create new case
