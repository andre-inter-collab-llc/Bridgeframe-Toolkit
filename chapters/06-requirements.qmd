## Requirements Analysis & Data Analysis

Raw elicitation findings must be organized, analyzed, and specified in detail. In business analysis, this is **Requirements Analysis and Design Definition**. In public health, it maps to **Data Analysis** and **Logic Model Development**. Both processes transform unstructured input into structured, actionable specifications.

### The Dual Framework

| BA Perspective | PH Perspective |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| Requirements Analysis | Data Analysis |
| Requirements Specification | Logic Model / Theory of Change |
| Functional Requirements | Program Activities |
| Non-Functional Requirements | Implementation Characteristics |
| Data Requirements | Case Definitions, Data Dictionaries |
| Business Rules | Clinical Guidelines, Protocols |

### Types of Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

**BA Definition:** What the system must do. Capabilities, features, functions.

**PH Equivalent:** Program activities, intervention components, service delivery specifications.

::: {.callout-note title="CancerSurv Example"}
**Functional Requirement (BA format):**

> FR-101: The system shall allow users to search for cases by patient name, medical record number, or social security number.

**Program Activity (PH format):**

> Cancer registrars will abstract and code incident cases from hospital pathology reports within 6 months of diagnosis date.

Both describe "what happens" but at different levels of specificity.
:::

#### Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

**BA Definition:** Quality attributes, constraints, performance characteristics.

**PH Equivalent:** Implementation characteristics (per CFIR framework).

| NFR Category | BA Focus | PH Focus (CFIR Domain) |
|:-------------|:---------|:-----------------------|
| **Performance** | Response time, throughput | Efficiency of intervention delivery |
| **Security** | Access control, encryption | HIPAA compliance, trust |
| **Scalability** | Growth capacity | Outbreak surge response |
| **Usability** | User interface design | Complexity, ease of adoption |
| **Reliability** | Uptime, fault tolerance | Service continuity |
| **Interoperability** | API standards, data exchange | Health information exchange |

::: {.callout-note title="CancerSurv Example"}
**NFR (BA format):**

> NFR-201: The system shall maintain 99.9% uptime during business hours (8 AM to 6 PM Eastern).

**Implementation Characteristic (PH format):**

> The CancerSurv platform must demonstrate high reliability to maintain registrar confidence and ensure continuous data collection, critical during cancer awareness campaigns when reporting volumes increase.

#### Data Requirements

Data specifications are central to both domains:

**BA Data Model:**

- Entity-Relationship diagrams
- Database schemas
- Data dictionaries
- Validation rules

**PH Case Definitions:**

- Diagnostic criteria
- Inclusion/exclusion criteria
- Coding standards (ICD-O-3, TNM)
- Data quality metrics

```{mermaid}

%%| fig-cap: "CancerSurv Simplified Data Model"
erDiagram
    PATIENT ||--o{ TUMOR : has
    TUMOR ||--o{ TREATMENT : receives
    TUMOR ||--|| DIAGNOSIS : "classified by"
    FACILITY ||--o{ TUMOR : reports
    
    PATIENT {
        string patient_id PK
        string name
        date birth_date
        string ssn
        string address
    }
    
    TUMOR {
        string tumor_id PK
        string patient_id FK
        date diagnosis_date
        string primary_site
        string histology
        string stage
    }
```

#### Business Rules / Clinical Guidelines

Rules governing system behavior and data processing:

| BA Business Rule | PH Clinical Guideline |
|:-----------------|:----------------------|
| "Order cannot be placed if credit limit exceeded" | "Case is reportable if primary site is within state jurisdiction" |
| "Discount applies if quantity > 100" | "Stage is unknown if pathology report unavailable within 4 months" |
| "Manager approval required for refunds > $500" | "Multiple primary rules apply per SEER guidelines" |

### The Logic Model as Requirements Framework

Public health uses the **Logic Model** to specify program components. This structure maps directly to requirements categories:

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-logic-requirements
%%| fig-cap: "Logic Model Components Mapped to Requirements"
flowchart LR
    subgraph Inputs[" "]
        I["**Inputs**<br/>(Resources)<br/>───────<br/>Funding<br/>Staff<br/>Data feeds<br/>Infrastructure"]
    end
    
    subgraph Activities[" "]
        A["**Activities**<br/>(Functions)<br/>───────<br/>Case abstraction<br/>Data quality<br/>Reporting<br/>Analytics"]
    end
    
    subgraph Outputs[" "]
        O["**Outputs**<br/>(Deliverables)<br/>───────<br/>Case records<br/>Quality reports<br/>NPCR submissions<br/>Dashboards"]
    end
    
    subgraph Outcomes[" "]
        OC["**Outcomes**<br/>(Success Metrics)<br/>───────<br/>95% completeness<br/>Timely reporting<br/>User satisfaction"]
    end
    
    I --> A --> O --> OC
```

| Logic Model Component | Requirements Category |
|:----------------------|:----------------------|
| Inputs | Constraints, Assumptions, Dependencies |
| Activities | Functional Requirements |
| Outputs | System Deliverables, Features |
| Outcomes | Success Metrics, Acceptance Criteria |
| Impact | Strategic Objectives, Business Value |

### Prioritization

#### Methods for Ranking Requirements

Not all requirements are equal. Prioritization ensures critical needs are addressed first:

**MoSCoW Method:**

- **Must have**: Essential for go-live
- **Should have**: Important but not critical
- **Could have**: Desirable if time permits
- **Won't have**: Out of scope for this release

**Weighted Scoring:**

Assign weights to criteria (business value, regulatory requirement, user impact) and score each requirement.

**Kano Model:**

- Basic needs (expected, cause dissatisfaction if missing)
- Performance needs (more is better)
- Delighters (unexpected features that excite)

::: {.callout-note title="CancerSurv Example"}
**Must Have:**

- Case entry and coding functionality
- HIPAA-compliant security
- NPCR data submission capability

**Should Have:**

- Real-time analytics dashboard
- Mobile-friendly interface
- Automated duplicate detection

**Could Have:**

- Machine learning for coding assistance
- Patient portal for self-reported outcomes
- Integration with research databases
:::

### Requirements Traceability

#### Linking Requirements to Objectives

Traceability ensures every requirement connects to a business need or program goal:

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-traceability
%%| fig-cap: "Requirements Traceability Structure"
flowchart TB
    BN[Business Need /<br/>Program Goal] --> FR[Functional<br/>Requirement]
    BN --> NFR[Non-Functional<br/>Requirement]
    FR --> TC[Test Case]
    NFR --> TC
    FR --> US[User Story]
    TC --> TR[Test Result]
```

**Traceability Matrix Example:**

| Requirement ID | Description | Source | Priority | Test Case |
|:---------------|:------------|:-------|:---------|:----------|
| FR-101 | Case search functionality | Registrar interviews | Must | TC-101, TC-102 |
| FR-102 | ICD-O-3 coding validation | NAACCR standards | Must | TC-103 |
| NFR-201 | 99.9% uptime | SLA requirements | Must | TC-201 |

### Specification Formats

#### Writing Good Requirements

Regardless of format, good requirements share characteristics:

| Characteristic | Description | Example |
|:---------------|:------------|:--------|
| **Complete** | Contains all necessary information | Includes error handling, edge cases |
| **Consistent** | Does not contradict other requirements | Uses standard terminology |
| **Unambiguous** | Only one interpretation possible | "Within 3 seconds" not "quickly" |
| **Verifiable** | Can be tested | Measurable acceptance criteria |
| **Traceable** | Links to source and test | Includes requirement ID |

#### User Story Format

For Agile projects:

> As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit].

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Given [context], when [action], then [result]

#### GPS Format for Clinical Contexts

> Given [clinical context], the [health worker role] should [specific action] to [health outcome].

::: {.callout-note title="CancerSurv Example"}
**User Story:**

> As a cancer registrar, I want to search for existing cases before creating a new record, so that I avoid creating duplicate entries.

**GPS Format:**

> Given a new pathology report, the registrar should search existing cases by patient identifiers before abstracting, to maintain data integrity and accurate incidence counts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Given a patient name, when the registrar searches, then matching cases display within 3 seconds
- Given a patient with no existing cases, when the registrar searches, then a "No matches found" message displays with option to create new case
