# The CancerSurv Case Study

Throughout this book, we use a single comprehensive case study to illustrate concepts: **CancerSurv**, a cloud-based cancer surveillance and registry system. This chapter introduces the project context, stakeholders, and objectives that will appear in examples across all subsequent chapters.

## Project Overview

A state public health department partners with TechHealth Solutions, a health IT company, to develop CancerSurv: a modern, cloud-based platform for cancer surveillance and registry operations.

### The Business Context

| Attribute | Detail |
|:----------|:-------|
| **Public Health Partner** | State Cancer Registry (Department of Health) |
| **Technology Partner** | TechHealth Solutions (cloud software vendor) |
| **Funding Source** | CDC National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) grant |
| **Timeline** | 18-month phased implementation |
| **Scope** | Replace legacy mainframe system with modern cloud solution |

### The Public Health Context

Cancer registries serve a critical public health function. They collect, process, and analyze data on cancer incidence, treatment, and outcomes. This data informs:

- Prevention program targeting
- Early detection initiatives
- Health disparity identification
- Research and clinical trials
- Healthcare resource planning

The state's current system, built on 1990s mainframe technology, cannot meet modern demands for interoperability, real-time analytics, and remote access.

## Stakeholder Landscape

Understanding who participates in this project requires seeing stakeholders through both BA and PH lenses:

| Role | BA Term | PH Term | Key Concerns |
|:-----|:--------|:--------|:-------------|
| Project Sponsor | Executive Sponsor | Registry Director / State Epidemiologist | Budget, timeline, CDC compliance |
| End Users | System Users | Cancer Registrars, Epidemiologists, Data Analysts | Usability, efficiency, data quality |
| Subject Matter Experts | Business SMEs | Oncologists, Pathologists, Tumor Board Members | Clinical accuracy, coding standards |
| External Partners | Vendors / Integrators | Hospitals, Laboratories, Vital Records | Data submission, interoperability |
| Oversight Bodies | Governance Board | NPCR Program, NAACCR Standards Committee | Standards compliance, data quality metrics |

::: {.callout-important title="Terminology Note"}
While we use "stakeholder" here for its familiarity in BA contexts, public health practitioners often prefer alternatives: community partners, interest holders, rights holders, or beneficiaries. The choice of term signals values: "stakeholder" implies an interest or stake, while "rights holder" acknowledges inherent claims and dignity. See Chapter 3 for detailed discussion.

## System Functions

CancerSurv must support five core functional areas:

### Case Abstraction

Cancer registrars enter and code cancer cases from medical records. This involves:

- Extracting relevant data from pathology reports, discharge summaries, and treatment records
- Coding diagnoses using ICD-O-3 (International Classification of Diseases for Oncology)
- Staging tumors using TNM and SEER summary staging
- Linking cases to patients across multiple treatment facilities

### Data Quality

Automated processes ensure data completeness and accuracy:

- Edit checks flagging inconsistent or missing data
- Duplicate detection identifying potential duplicate case records
- Linkage to vital records for death clearance
- Inter-rater reliability monitoring

### Reporting

The registry must meet external reporting requirements:

- Annual submissions to NPCR (National Program of Cancer Registries)
- Data exchange with SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program)
- Ad-hoc queries for researchers (with appropriate IRB approval)
- Public health reports for state legislature and media

### Analytics Dashboard

Modern surveillance requires real-time analytics:

- Cancer incidence trends by site, stage, and demographics
- Geographic mapping of cancer clusters
- Survival analysis and outcomes tracking
- Health disparity indicators

### Interoperability

CancerSurv must integrate with external systems:

- HL7 FHIR APIs for hospital EHR integration
- Electronic pathology reporting from laboratories
- Vital records linkage for death data
- National data exchange protocols

## Project Phases

The 18-month implementation follows a phased approach, which we will revisit throughout the book:

## How CancerSurv Appears in This Book

Each chapter includes CancerSurv examples demonstrating concepts in practice:

- **Planning (Chapter 4)**: Needs assessment comparing cancer data gaps with CDC reporting requirements
- **Elicitation (Chapter 5)**: User stories from registrars; clinical guidelines from oncologists
- **Requirements (Chapter 6)**: Functional specifications for case entry; NFRs for HIPAA compliance
- **Design (Chapter 7)**: System architecture; CFIR implementation readiness assessment
- **Implementation (Chapter 8)**: Agile sprints mapped to grant milestones; PDSA cycles for workflow adoption
- **Evaluation (Chapter 9)**: KPIs (data completeness ≥95%) mapped to health outcomes

When reading subsequent chapters, refer back to this overview to ground abstract concepts in the CancerSurv context. The case study makes the BA-PH bridge tangible.

## The Dual Mandate

CancerSurv illustrates the fundamental tension bridged by this book. The project must simultaneously satisfy:

**Technology Requirements:**

- Modern cloud architecture
- API-first design
- Agile delivery methodology
- Vendor best practices

**Public Health Requirements:**

- CDC/NPCR compliance
- NAACCR data standards
- HIPAA security
- Health equity focus

Success requires translation between these worldviews. That is what Bridgeframe provides.
