## Planning & Strategy / Needs Assessment

Every successful project begins with understanding the problem. In business analysis, this phase is called **Strategy Analysis** or **Planning**. In public health, it is the **Needs Assessment** or **Community Health Assessment**. Both seek to answer the same fundamental question: What problem are we solving, and for whom?

### The Dual Framework

| BA Perspective | PH Perspective |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| Business Need | Public Health Challenge |
| Current State Analysis | Epidemiological Baseline |
| Future State Vision | Program Goals & Intended Outcomes |
| Stakeholder Identification | Community Partner Mapping |
| Feasibility Assessment | Resource & Capacity Analysis |

### Defining the Problem

#### Business Analysis Approach

In traditional BA, the business need emerges from organizational pain points:

- Revenue decline
- Operational inefficiency
- Compliance gaps
- Competitive pressure
- Technology obsolescence

The BA documents this in a **Business Case** that quantifies the problem, proposes solutions, and projects return on investment.

#### Public Health Approach

In public health, the need emerges from population health data:

- Disease incidence and prevalence
- Health disparities across demographics
- Service access gaps
- Outbreak patterns
- Unmet community needs

The epidemiologist documents this in a **Needs Assessment** that quantifies health burden, identifies determinants, and prioritizes interventions.

::: {.callout-note title="CancerSurv Example"}
**Business Need (BA framing):** The legacy mainframe system is approaching end-of-life. Maintenance costs have increased 40% over three years. The system cannot support modern interoperability requirements or remote work.

**Public Health Challenge (PH framing):** Cancer data completeness has declined to 89%, below the CDC target of 95%. Late-stage diagnoses are increasing in rural counties, suggesting gaps in early detection. The current system cannot support the real-time analytics needed to identify and address disparities.

Both framings describe the same project. The BA framing emphasizes operational efficiency; the PH framing emphasizes health outcomes. Effective planning addresses both.

### Current State Analysis

#### Documenting What Exists

Before defining requirements, understand what currently exists. The approaches differ in emphasis but serve the same purpose:

**BA Current State Analysis:**

- Process maps (BPMN diagrams)
- System inventories
- Pain point interviews
- Performance metrics
- Technical debt assessment

**PH Epidemiological Baseline:**

- Disease surveillance data
- Demographic health profiles
- Service utilization patterns
- Health equity indicators
- Environmental and social determinants

#### Data Sources for Current State

| BA Data Sources | PH Data Sources |
|:----------------|:----------------|
| System logs, usage analytics | Disease registries, vital records |
| User surveys, interviews | Community health surveys (BRFSS) |
| Process documentation | Clinical guidelines, protocols |
| Financial reports | Grant reports, program evaluations |
| Vendor assessments | CDC/state health department data |

### Future State Vision

#### Defining Success

The future state describes what success looks like. Again, the framing differs:

**BA Future State:**

- System capabilities and features
- Process improvements
- Performance targets
- Technical architecture
- Integration landscape

**PH Program Goals:**

- Health outcome improvements
- Disparity reductions
- Service access expansion
- Quality metrics
- Population health indicators

#### SMART Objectives

Both domains benefit from SMART objective setting:

| Component | BA Example | PH Example |
|:----------|:-----------|:-----------|
| **Specific** | Reduce case entry time | Increase early-stage cancer detection |
| **Measurable** | From 15 to 8 minutes per case | From 45% to 55% of cases |
| **Achievable** | Based on vendor benchmarks | Based on peer state performance |
| **Relevant** | Supports registrar productivity | Supports prevention targeting |
| **Time-bound** | Within 6 months of go-live | Within 2 years of program launch |

::: {.callout-note title="CancerSurv Example"}
**SMART Objective (Dual Framing):**

*BA:* "Within 6 months of CancerSurv deployment, average case abstraction time will decrease from 15 minutes to 8 minutes, as measured by system audit logs."

*PH:* "Within 2 years of CancerSurv deployment, data completeness will increase from 89% to 95%, enabling accurate survival analysis and disparity identification for the state cancer plan."

Both objectives are valid; both should appear in project documentation.

### Stakeholder / Community Partner Identification

#### Mapping the Landscape

Identifying who participates in the project requires understanding both organizational and community perspectives:

#### Power-Interest Analysis

The classic BA power-interest grid maps to PH community engagement levels:

| Quadrant | BA Approach | PH Approach |
|:---------|:------------|:------------|
| High Power, High Interest | Manage closely | Active partnership |
| High Power, Low Interest | Keep satisfied | Inform and consult |
| Low Power, High Interest | Keep informed | Empower and involve |
| Low Power, Low Interest | Monitor | Ensure representation |

### Feasibility Assessment

#### Can We Do This?

Both domains assess feasibility before committing resources:

**BA Feasibility Dimensions:**

- Technical feasibility (Can we build it?)
- Economic feasibility (Can we afford it?)
- Operational feasibility (Can we run it?)
- Schedule feasibility (Can we deliver on time?)

**PH Feasibility Dimensions:**

- Evidence base (Does the intervention work?)
- Resource availability (Do we have funding, staff?)
- Political will (Is there leadership support?)
- Community readiness (Will the population engage?)
- Ethical considerations (Is it equitable?)

::: {.callout-tip title="Bridging Tip"}
When presenting feasibility to mixed audiences, address both technical and programmatic dimensions. A system that is technically feasible but lacks community buy-in will fail. An intervention with strong evidence but no technical infrastructure cannot scale.

### Deliverables from This Phase

| BA Deliverable | PH Deliverable | Purpose |
|:---------------|:---------------|:--------|
| Business Case | Needs Assessment Report | Justify the project |
| Stakeholder Register | Community Partner Map | Identify participants |
| Current State Analysis | Epidemiological Baseline | Document starting point |
| Future State Vision | Program Goals | Define success |
| Feasibility Study | Readiness Assessment | Confirm viability |

### Common Pitfalls

**For BA professionals entering PH:**

- Underestimating regulatory constraints (HIPAA, IRB)
- Ignoring health equity implications
- Treating clinical workflows like business processes
- Missing grant-cycle dependencies

**For PH professionals working with BA:**

- Providing needs assessments instead of requirements
- Assuming IT teams understand clinical context
- Underspecifying data quality needs
- Ignoring change management complexity

### Moving Forward

With the problem defined and feasibility confirmed, the next phase focuses on **Elicitation**: gathering detailed information from stakeholders and community partners about their specific needs and constraints.
